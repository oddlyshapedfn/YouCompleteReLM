{"text": "<YCR>: October 10, 2003  To address the lack of updates, random hate, and various infos  First, to address the obvious lack of updates on the site (it's been almost a month since the last one).  Pretty much nothing going on.  I'm busy with school and work 99% of the time, so there's not a lot of time to bullshit.  But I'm going to update when I do feel it's appropriate, or when something interesting happens that I feel I need to pass on.  So, without further ado, let's get to it.  POST ON THE TOP HATERS FORUMS YOU FUCKERS! WE NEED FEEDBACK FOR IMPACT and I need feedback about this site, to know what you want to see on it. SO GIVE IT TO ME!  Item #2 on the agenda: The Cannons apparently care so much about me, that they've found a way to totally block me from viewing Shoryuken.com, EVEN through an IP-blocking utility.  I guess they hate me THAT MUCH, and are still thinking about me.  Which I find pretty hilarious because 1. I don't EVER think about them, or mention them ever, even on this site, unless something new happens that I feel is worth mentioning. There are no anti-Cannon diatribes or hate articles on this site, so why all the attention?  I've left it totally clean since EVO and yet they still continue to do shit.  And of course 2. I STILL POST ON SRK WHENEVER I WANT.  It's pretty hilarious to be honest.  If you have a problem with me Tom and Tony, why not voice it? Why not publicly say what's on your minds, and why you care so much about me? Oh, because that's not what you do. You wouldn't have the balls to show up anywhere and confront your enemies, like I did at EVO2k2 a while back.  Instead, you hide behind your computers and ban people, then laugh to yourselves like you have some kind of power.  Give me a break, guys, and grow some balls.  It's little faggots like you that keep shit going that piss me off.  Either let it drop, or take it to the next level; but the whole ban thing is getting way old, and seeing that you're still thinking about me and finding new ways to annoy me is pretty pathetic.  Here, let me make it easy for you: I'll fight you both, at the same time, IN PUBLIC in a publicized match, so we can finally end this thing and move on, and prove I fucking own you.  All the source code in the world won't help you then. Now STOP THINKING ABOUT ME, I'm way both of your lame asses, christ.  Moving on...  I don't know how many of you follow anime, but the best one out right now is probably Naruto.  It's based off of a very long manga that's still going on in Japan, just like all the other animes.  The plot is pretty good in itself, the art and action are awesome, and the dialogue is priceless.  My only gripe with the series is that there are pauses for convos, and background stories, and other crap right in the middle of fights.  I dunno about you guys, but I don't stop to stand around and pose and talk for 10 minutes in the middle of a heated fight.  It reminds me all too much of DBZ and the fucking Shakespearean sonnets they used to blab out instead of just pummeling each other into oblivion.  The one anime that knew what was up and just let everybody fuck each other up all day, Fist of the North Star, fucking rocked.  So get a clue, Naruto, and let people smash each other's brains in without all the drama.  PLOT MOVEMENT is a key to a successful story.  I give Naruto  3 out of 4 middle-fingers up, as far as anime goes.  Good shit.  Speaking of Naruto, you can get a lot of the mangas at http://130.149.17.156/~rmazores/naruto/ for free, totally translated to English.  Go to www.suprnova.org to download all the Naruto eps, then start reading the mangas.  The mangas leave off a little bit after where the anime ends, but within a few more eps I'm sure the anime will catch up.  By the way, SUPER SHOUT OUT to Tragic for providing that info and letting me know about Naruto to begin with.  Of all the EVO tourney directors, Tragic is the bomb-shizzlest.  In other news...  I'm currently rebuilding my comp because, for whatever reason, my current setup began to smell like an electrical fire for about the past two weeks.  Since I have so much valuable stuff on here, I have to get this fixed FAST.  So I went to TigerDirect.com and basically got a kick-ass setup for under $500, including P4 2.4gz 800FSB with hyper-threading, 512 DDR400 RAM, 425-watt power supply with a kick-ass black case, Intel motherboard with four USB 2.0 slots and all the bells and whistles, and lots of cooling shit so it doesn't overheat. Only thing I'm keeping is my CD burner, hard drives, and graphics card. So all in all, if I had purchased it all, I would have spent like $800 for a sick system.  Why people pay $1500 or more for a computer EVER is beyond me.  Just build it yourself, you fat lazy people!  Oh yes...  GunBound is the shit.  http://www.gunbound.net  Go there now and get it, this I command!  Let's get a Top-Haters.com league of fucking players and start raping shit.  I'll start holding tournies for this game cuz it's fun as fuck, and it's free.  Team tourneys are the bomb anyway.  IMPACT is still going down, but nothing definite has been decided.  It's looking like ECC IS GOING TO HAPPEN in 2004 and IMPACT is going to be a totally separate event.  We're now looking somewhere next fall, because right now the fall is DEAD tournament-wise and it would be nice to be able to have it at a point where it's not conflicting with people traveling to 80 other major tournies within the same three months.  We're also looking at making it totally revolutionary and different by having it at an already awesome event...like a comic-book con etc...to keep people busy and not bored out of their minds when matches aren't being played, etc.  But we'll keep you posted.  Really only one other thing of note as of now: If you live in Connecticut or NYC or any surrounding areas, head down to FYE in Westfield Shoppingtown in Trumbull on Sundays. We're getting some gaming together to get some interesting going again.  Basically we'll start out at FYE during the afternoon with the two MvC2s they have, which have 360 sticks and jap buttons. When that gets boring (and we're bored of being mallrats chasing after 14-year-old chicks) we'll head over to What's Your Game? in Bridgeport which is like 10 minutes away (not even) and easy to get to.   Plus, it's right next to the highway.  They have SNK vs Capcom, Third Strike, MvC2 (crappy controls though), as well as old favorites like KI1, MK2, and other stuff.  They also have pool, so you can play for money and make everyone look like fools while you run a table.  Anyway, basically if you're in the tri-state area you should start to make some trips down here instead of making CT come to you all the time.  There's plenty to do so you have no excuse.  And by the way, Dru said he'd play MvC2 for money!  Until next time, fuck off.  ~DSP", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}

{"text": "<YCR>: March 11, 2004  New HATE MAIL  Every once in a while, someone sends me some e-mail related to the site.  Sadly, some people's brains must not be functioning when they come, because I've gotten some real nasty mail in the time that Top-Haters.com has been up.  Everything from \"you're an ASSHOLE\" to \"my vomit looks better than your site.\"  Although both are good points, sometimes I get some e-mails that are really just off-base.  Case in point: here's an e-mail I received today while in the middle of a vigorous porno viewing session.  Apparently this spry young man read my cosplay article and felt inclined to comment on something I said:  mmm well regarding this comment \"This is unfortunate, because if she were not a total loser, this girl would actually be a hot piece of ass.  If I were to fuck this girl, I would have to fuck her RIGHT IN THE POOPSHOOT because actually sticking my dick in her pussy would probably reflect some kind of respect for her, and that's something I definitely don't want to do.  Well I really doubt that any girl would even contiplate spleeping with you as you are probley one of those extrememly ugly guys who cosplay, and you have only made this site so to fool your self, plus you  really do sound like a  real wanker.  Any way thats just what I think, we all have our opinons dont we, have a good day.  Well, all in good fun, now it's my turn to reply.  I thought about what you said a long time, Mr. Nathan Cox <ferrari_1985@hotmail.com>.  And you know what, I agree with you.  I really, really doubt that any girl would ever contiplate spleeping with me either.  And I'm really glad.  Because if a girl ever said she was contiplating spleeping with me, it would probably mean she had a hideously dislocated jaw, or ridiculously big front teeth.  And I would smack her hillbilly ass all the way back to Mississippi so she could fuck her uncle some more.  ...that is, of course, unless she had a hot body. Then I'd cover her face with an issue of Gamepro magazine and FUCK HER IN THE POOPSHOOT. Hey, what do you know, that mag IS good for something.  Now as for your accusations about cosplaying.  Let me tell you a little bit about myself.  I'm 6 feet tall, and weigh about 195 pounds. I'm built, but out of shape. I used to lift weights.  I have been complemented by many at tournaments on the way that I dress.  A lot of people wonder where I get my shirts and skullies from.  All I can say is that I have an undeniably badass taste in clothing.  The only person who's said otherwise was a guy named Big Dave, but he's a fag anyway, and he looks like Urkel, so he's not one to talk.  But I have never...............EVER........EVER dressed up in cosplay, and I never will. I am a HETEROSEXUAL, not some slimy fat fuck who smells like a sweaty nutsack and has pieces of old donuts stuck in his stubble of a beard.  I'm not some crossdressing closet case bisexual who thinks that \"it's okay to dress up as a female anime character as long as it's all in good fun.\"  And one thing I'm definitely not is some moronic internet critic with a british accent, who is so fucking stupid he can't even type a hate mail utilizing the skills of fourth grade spelling.  You are, in your own words,  EXTREMEMLY retarded.  Wanker?  Do you really think I'm a wanker?  What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  Oh, I know, it means I'm American and you're not, so I fucking OWN YOU.  I wish I knew if you lived in Britain or Australia or another one of those assinine places, so I could run up to your front door, kick it down, run up into your room and SHIT RIGHT IN YOUR MOUTH.  I've got a few lincoln logs saved up just for you, buddy, so come and get em' while they're still hot!  What the fuck took you so long to find my cosplay article anyway?  It's been written since November, so that means it took you 1.....2........FIVE months to fucking read it!  A bit slow are you?  Congratulations, Nathan Cox! You've won the first ever Top-Haters.com  SPHINCTER OF THE MONTH AWARD!  Now, next time you want to tell me all about your OPINONS, please keep your OPINONS to yourself!

I'm working on an ECC grudge-match promo video, and I'm in desperate need of footage of Mike Mixup from Florida, SooMighty from Cali, and random NON-East Coast people who will be attending ECC this year.  Pics are also very useful.  I have enough footage of MvC2 to make me vomit, but I need footage and/or pics of these two particular players.  Next, I have started an official Top-Haters thread on SRK. If you visit the site and want to support and/or criticize it, go here:  http://www.shoryuken.com/forums/thread56232.php  And now, the big announcement.  Top-Haters.com will begin recruiting shortly. That's right! Now you can  JOIN THE  and be an official Top-Hater!  That's right, DSP wants YOU to join the HATE ARMY and help rid the world of tight-ass SF players!  In the year that Top-Haters has existed, we've done more than just ran an ugly website. Our achievements include: -Created the most popular SF-related promotional video ever! -Started a series of candid interviews featuring prominent East Coast players, that you can't see anywhere else -Won several grudge matches against the Empire for money, making them eat their words and their faggy shirts.  Total amount of money taken from the Empire to date: $325! -Top-Haters.com was the ONLY website to provide accurate, play-by-play tournaments results for EVO 2k3 last year. And we took some serious hate for it too! -Started a series of no-holds-barred editorials -Had our bandwidth exceeded THREE times due to massive visits and downloads  Top-Haters.com is the ONLY place you can get full news on East Coast tournaments, events, and more. Top-Haters has become and independent website and an underground staple of the Street Fighter community.  SO, how do you sign up, and what do you get?  All you have to do is send me an email. If you look to the left, you'll see that in the menu bar there is a new link to JOIN THE HATE ARMY.  When you do so, you'll get:  -Membership to the top-haters.com mail list. You'll get updates every time that the site is updated, so you know when to check it (since I don't always update on a regular basis).  -Members will get EXCLUSIVE first looks at video projects that I've completed. This means that when I finish the ECC grudge match promo video, you'll get to download it a few days before the rest of the SF community.  -You'll also get a heads up as to when grudge matches involving the top-haters are happening.  A grudge match between Josh Wigfall and I is going to take place soon, so I'll keep you posted.  -A lot of people have expressed interest in Top-Haters.com shirts and gear. Right now I have no plans to \"go commercial,\" but if enough interest is shown, I'll definitely put some thought into designing a few bad-ass t-shirts, hats, or something. And only members of the HATE ARMY will be able to purchase these at a discount!  -Your name will be added to the official roster of Top-Haters.com, to be posted on this website.    So, if you want to be a part of the best, most badass SF website ever to grace the earth, and you want to support what we do, join the HATE ARMY today!

{"text": "<YCR>: April 16, 2004  PC Game Roundup  Sup guys, I'm back after a few weeks of pain-in-the-ass work. I just recently got a Radeon 9800 Pro graphics card for my birthday (and of course, they immediately announce the release of the next-gen cards a few days after, FUCKERS) so I've been playing a lot of PC games as of late.  Most notably I've been keeping busy with Unreal Tournament 2004, and the recently released Far Cry.  Here's the skinny on these new FPS shoot-em-ups.  Unreal Tournament 2004  This contraption is actually one of the maps for assault mode. Just one of the many original ideas added to UT2k4. Too bad only four game modes are actually played.  The most highly anticipated FPS in a while would undoubtedly have to be UT2k4. Unreal Tournament has become a staple in the competitive FPS category with exceptional quality, and UT2k4 is no exception.  When released early in March, the servers were almost overflowing with players, and the numbers are increasing. The addition of new visuals, several new game modes, text-to-speech and voice chat have given some new life to this classic FPS. Let's get down to it.  Visuals:  UT2k4 gives us some of the most original and refreshing visuals in a long time. Still going with its space-age theme, you'll see a lot of wacky new skins including robots, humans, weird-looking aliens with tentacle dreadlocks, and the occasional fat guy. Okay, so I lied, only bots pick the fat guy. Map-wise, there are a lot of winners, but a few losers. It looks like they really tried to go for some pretty settings, but in some cases, it just doesn't work.  There is one map in particular used for deathmatch that is entirely dark green, with shade and other dark corners to hide.  That would be fine, except for the fact that you can't see shit 75% of the time, even with the gamma pumped all the way up. Anyone with a darker skin.....or the blue team in a team-deathmatch setting.....has a very unfair advantage.  As for the other maps, some are pretty dope. The settings for onslaught, the vehicle mode of the game, are well thought out.  Some are absolutely huge, with over 10 power node checkpoints, while others are VERY small, with one or two spots that become major choke points. A lot of new deathmatch and CTF maps are present. However, don't be surprised to see a lot of your old favorites from UT and UT2k3 showing up; Epic has updated a lot of the classic maps with better graphics and given them another go.  On top of all that, you'll find a few nice custom map servers out there.  Effects wise, the game is awesome.  Vehicles throw up dust from movement, shoot huge missiles at each other, and throw around electric ribbons.  The handheld weapons haven't changed much at all, so don't expect any new explosions in that department.  The game really knows how to use atmospheric effects like rain, smoke, shading, and environments to make the game interesting.  One map you'll be in an Egyptian temple fighting it out; the next you'll be in space on a mothership blowing your opponents to smithereens.  This is the HUMONGOUS fucking Ion Cannon from one of the assault games. I once blew up two tanks and a handful of guys on foot with one blast. That's a HUGE BITCH, and fun as hell.  One place Unreal Tournament 2k4 does not excel, however, is the FPS (frames per second) department. At first I thought it was my video card, but now that I have a Radeon 9800 pro all tweaked out, I know it's not me. I have a P4 2.4gz with hyper threading, a gig of DDR400 ram, and a broadband internet connection. Yet, I never seem to get more than 80-90 fps in deathmatch mode, and 40-60fps in assault/onslaught modes.  It's a shame that despite all the awesome effects and visuals, the FPS is so low. For deathmatch it's more than enough, but when you get into a firefight with vehicles or shit starts to blow up in assault, you will really hate the choppiness.  I asked around and it seems that everyone I know playing has this same problem, even with all the grahpics settings turned to low.  Gameplay:  Never fear, all of your favorite rocket-launching, double jumping, teleporting craziness is back. UT2k4 has some of the most innovative modes ever to be found in a first person shooter.  Over seven game modes give it immense replay value. By far the best modes are classic deathmatch, capture the flag, assault, and the new onslaught mode. Many have compared onslaught mode to Halo, but it's not; it's better, the vehicles have more variety to them, and it's fun as hell. Load three guys into a Warthog, the jeep-like car that has lazers and electrical cannons, and you become a wrecking crew. Tanks, flying jets, hovercraft that can slam down and squish bad guys, and the LEVIATHAN, the five-man moving deathtrap, all make this mode truly awesome.  If you have not played UT2k4 yet, I highly recommend you sit down and play Onslaught mode at least once.  Assault mode is also really cool. Your team is assigned to complete a certain number of goals on a large map, while the other team is assigned to prevent you from doing it within a time limit.  Tasks range from attacking and storming a mothership, to powering up a superjeep and escaping with it, to blowing up town hall in an earth-like city.  Lots of variety, lots of fun.  One of the new badass skins. Too bad the FPS suffer for all the purty visuals.  The classic deathmatch hasn't changed much at all. All the double-jumping, sidestepping action is still there, and the weapons haven't changed much either. It seems like Epic spent most of the time on the newer game modes like Onslaught instead of adding to deathmatch. But you know what they say: don't fix what's not broken. And UT2k4 deathmatch is certainly not broken in any respect: it's fast, it's fun, and it's highly competitive.  The weapon damage and speed has been slightly tweaked, but nothing to complain about.  My only gripe about UT2k4 is that most of the game modes are ignored. Team Deathmatch, Bombing Run (a football-like game), Invasion (where you team up with other players against a legion of computer-controlled monsters), Mutant, and a few other game modes are barely touched at all. It's hard as hell to find servers for these modes, and it really takes away from the game. There is a lot of variety available, but it seems that most people just want to fly around in vehicles all day in onslaught mode, or blow people up in deathmatch.  It's also hard to find ANY game where people are actually acting well as a team, despite the addition of voice chat and text-to-speech (having the computer speak out what you type). It seems everyone just wants to take off like an idiot, leaving you behind even though he's driving off in a three-person vehicle and has no gunner. Most people go straight for Onslaught mode for the first week they play UT2k4, but it gets old after a few days of mindless explosions and homing missiles shooting you out of nowhere.  The bottom line:  UT2k4 is way better than any of the previous incarnations. Having multiple game modes gives the game added replay and fun value, and they haven't changed anything they didn't need to.  The visuals are dope.  On the other hand, it's hard to find any team games with cooperation actually present, and the FPS suffers in some game modes no matter what system you're using.  Finally, some game modes go totally ignored, while others are packed with players. This is both a good and a bad thing; you WILL have fun with Onslaught for at least a week, but when you finally get tired, you'll have to settle for one of the three or so other modes that actually have players.  Overall, Top-Haters.com gives UT2k4  Four and a half middle fingers out of five  Which means it's pretty fucking good.    Far Cry  Ha, I stole some dumbass's  jeep. Should I go complete the mission?  Nah, I'll just go check out some babes on the beach.  Our next game is the first from newcomer Crytek. If you've never heard of Crytek, you're not the first. These guys literally came out of nowhere and produced an awesome, original FPS that is nothing like I've ever played.  Innovative gameplay along with the best visuals to EVER come from a PC game so far combine to make Far Cry one hell of a contender for game of the year.  The Visuals:  The only words that come to mind when I think of Far Cry's visuals are \"beautiful\" and \"stunning.\"  Everything about the looks of this game is original.  It starts with the ability to zoom in OVER A MILE and snipe your enemies. Unlike most other FPS games, the horizon won't mysteriously vanish in a cloud of strange fog.  Instead, you'll be able to see EVERYTHING, ALL THE TIME as it's all drawn in realtime.  No loading between rooms here thanks to the new Crytek engine. What you would be able to see in real life if you were on this island, you can see in Far Cry.  You'll notice that the environments in Far Cry are also gorgeous. The water effects in this game are the best out of any game, ever. You can look into the tide and see your reflection; if you're under the water, you will see the same effects of visual distortion near the surface that you would see in real life. You can really tell that Crytek put a lot of work into the water dynamics in this game.  IT LOOKS LIKE LIQUID god dammit.  The jungle is also lush with grass, ferns, rocks, hills, trees, and all kinds of realistic foliage and settings. Never before have I felt as \"into\" a game as I have since I played Far Cry for the first time.   Being able to tell when someone is coming from their shadow on the wall, or from their flashlight trail on the side of the cave, is also pretty neat.  The environs are also super-realistic. You won't run into any ridiculous layouts like \"mysterious invisible wall that won't allow you to sneak behind that hut and take that guy by surprise.\" What you see is what you get, and they really designed the maps well.  But that takes us into our gameplay review.  The water effects in this game are so cool, you'll want to dive right in an take a dip.  Just don't mess around too long or you'll be full of holes.  The Gameplay:  Far Cry is one of the most original games ever. It's FPS done right.  First of all, it's super-realistic. If you get shot a few times, you are dead. No taking rockets in the face and living like in Unreal; if you get shot two or three times, you're done for. This leads to your desire to stealthily sneak around the island, rather than running headfirst into enemy camps, guns blasting.  The settings and maps are so well laid out, you will think you're in the woods for real.  You can sneak around the entire island, through ferns and around rivers, adding to the realistic stealth aspect of the game.  You can pretty much do ANYTHING YOU WANT with what's in front of you.  If you want to sneak up and take the guard tower, go for it.  Just don't complain when you're trapped up there, and seven guys are waiting for you at the bottom.  If you want to sneak into camp and try to slit everyone's throat from behind, go for it.  Or you can just steal a jeep and drive away, laughing hysterically; that is, until the enemies get into ANOTHER jeep and DRIVE AFTER YOU SHOOTING LIKE CRAZY.  The game is just so realistic, it's got to be played to be experienced.  Another good thing about the game is the ability to complete goals in different ways. You'll find the desire to want to replay a level over and over, to see if you can find a better (or funnier) way to accomplish your goals.  For example, in the second level you can either climb to the top of a tanker and fight a helicopter, handful of guys on foot, and a guy on a gun turret ALL AT ONCE......or you can find a secret boat on the level below there and escape quickly.  It's all up to you, how observant you are, and how much fun you want to have with the game.  (By the way, taking on the copter + 10 guys is ONLY for the hardcore ballsy FPS player).  This guy really wishes he had a clue. Maybe the bullet appearing between his eyes shortly will be a tip off.  The enemy AI in this game is superb.  If you kill one guy and sneak away, the others will find his body, know something is wrong, and begin a systematic sweep of the area.  If you run headfirst into a group of baddies, they will go into \"group attack mode\" and kill you within a few seconds.  However, it will take them a second or two to get themselves together, so you'll have some time to kill one or two of them and then run for cover.  But don't expect to get off easy; these guys will surround you and kill you in an intelligent manner. No ridiculous movie shootouts here where the bad guys can't hit for shit and keep running into bullets. You'll have to legitimately outsmart your opponents to survive.  The ability to steal anything around.....including weapons and vehicles.........just adds to the realism and cool factor of the game.  I have two minor gripes with Far Cry.  First, the game does not allow you to save wherever you want, but instead you have to rely on the frequent auto-save points (however, this is going to be fixed in a patch soon).  Second, the multiplayer mode is pure ass.  Being forced to connect through Ubi.com, the in-game multiplayer browser is a joke, and there are very few servers available to play on.  The game modes are pretty basic......deathmatch, team deathmatch, and objective-based assault......and the pings are high. Pretty fun for a few minutes, but after you spent 15 minutes looking for a decent game, and then experience your third lag spike, you'll be out of there.  The bottom line:  Far Cry is the most visually stunning, most well-programmed, and most realistic FPS to ever be released.  Crytek really hit gold with this game, and it's probably going to be right up there for Game of the Year with UT2k4.  The only real downside to the game is the lack of quick saves, and the crappy situation of the multiplayer mode. If you're into realistic single-player FPS games, buy this game immediately.  If you're more the multiplayer type, go for something else.  Top-Haters.com gives Far Cry  Four middle fingers out of five  For being the best single-player FPS, EVER.  That's it for now. Tomorrow (well, today now) is a huge day for movies, with the Punisher and Kill Bill 2 both being released. I'm going to see both, and I'll be back with reviews for you.  See you then.  ~DSP", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}

{"text": "<YCR>: March 16, 2004  Wreslemania XX RECAP  Just finished watching Wrestlemania XX with a bunch of friends. Overall, a great show, with a few rough edges. Here's the skinny.   Funniest moments:  -Bubba Dudley is machine gun punching Booker T a-la Billy Gunn, then goes for the crotch pump and yells SUCK ON THIS, getting ready to finish off Booker with the final punch. Booker then proceeds to side kick Bubba directly in the face at the perfect time. Hilarious. -Ultimo Dragon's entrance. He has a long, flowing cape on, comes out and TRIPS on it center stage, falling to one knee. Then he tries to play it off and goes to the ring, climbs up the turnbuckle, and SLIPS and falls to the mat. Hilarious. -Brock's SUPER CLOSE UP imitation of Goldberg's grin. HILARIOUS. Nice job, cameraman. -Rey Mysterio coming out as the Flash. No lie. Extremely similar logo on chest, full red skintight leather outfit, and pointy yellow ears. He looked like a fucking DC-brand condom. HILARIOUS.   Saddest moments: -Seeing Bobby Heenan so skinny and hearing how hoarse his voice is, after battling cancer.  Worst moments: -Playboy match. Not only can't these women wrestle, but they didn't get naked. Yet another softcore porn attempt that didn't even tease. And the cameraman didn't even get many good shits of T&A. Pathetic. -The Rock and Sock connection losing to Evolution. And Mick Foley losing to a random RKO from Orton after barely getting hit at all during the match. No blood from Mick at all and he just gets beaten so easily. This is the hardcore legend? Pretty lame ending to an otherwise good match up to that point. Have to figure out what the point of that match was......if it was to build up Evolution, it was pretty pointless, since HHH and Evolution make up 90% of the important stuff on RAW already. -Seeing HBK get legitimately ripped open after smashing his head into the ringpost after a slingshot from Benoit. OUCH. That was a fucking gusher and a half too. -Goldberg/Lesnar match. What a shitty fucking match. Two big guys walk around the ring for 10 minutes. Grapple. More walking. Spear. F5. Spear. Jackhammer. End of match. HUH? This was supposed to be a main event? No wonder it was put in the MIDDLE of the show, I guess Vince did good predicting that it would suck balls.  Best Moments: -All the right guys winning titles and deserving it. John Cena, RVD/Booker T, Chavo and Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit. -The Rock's usual antics pre-match. Also the Rock doing a peoples elbow on Ric Flair and imitating his famous strut in a ridiculous, exaggerated manner before dropping the bomb on him. -Billy Kidman doing a shooting star press to the OUTSIDE on top of Nunzio and Jamie Noble. Fucking up and driving his head and neck into Nunzio's shoulder instead of getting caught. Fucking hardcore. -Undertaker's return. He's still not the dead man. Paul bearer and druids come out, out comes taker in a long, black leather coat and a long brimmed leather hat, similar to his old dead man gimmick. Comes in the ring, takes off coat......he's dressed like the American Badass still, only with longer hair. Does fast moves like the Badass character too. BUT he's lost weight, buffed up, and much more mobile and faster now. PLUS he sits up, rolls his eyes and has Dead Man gimmicks integrated. I like the way they did this....somehow going back to pure dead man wouldn't make sense. -Austin stunning both Goldberg and Lesnar at the end of their horrible match.

{"text": "<YCR>: April 17, 2004  This is it! The Matchup you've been waiting for!                 VERSUS  A LOT of hype and anticipation has been thrown around in regard to these two movies. Ironic that both movies, released on the same day, both pretty much have generally the same plot: getting people back for ALMOST killing them/making their lives miserable.  Thanks to a last-minute media blitz and extensive hype, it looked like Kill Bill 2 would come out on top this weekend as the most-in-demand movie to see.  But does that necessarily mean that Kill Bill 2 was a better movie than the Punisher? Here's my take.  WARNING: If you do not want to read spoilers, DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER. Don't be a dumbass.  Kill Bill Volume 2: The Bride is Back  Uma Thurman with a gun. Either very tasty, or very stupid. I haven't decided which yet.  Kill Bill Volume 1 was an original movie. Not original in plot, but original in execution. It attempted to take some of the flair and style of the 1970's kung fu, samurai, martial arts movies, combine it with some anime craziness, and then add a touch of American flavor. And it worked quite nicely. What Quentin Tarantino dished out was truly a unique film: the story of a bride-to-be wrenched from her altar, witness to seeing all of her friends killed, taking a bullet to the head and having her unborn child taken from her by her former mentor/boyfriend, Bill.  The majority of the movie saw the Bride (as we were told to call her, since her named is bleeped out every time someone says it on camera) chasing down her former fellow assassins, ruthlessly murdering them one by one, and crossing them off her grim shopping list of death.  What really worked for Kill Bill Volume 1 was the fact that nothing had ever been done to that effect before. Kung Pow might have done a decent job of making fun of the 70's Kung Fu movies, but Kill Bill was something different. In a hard-to-categorize work of art, the first movie slapped together several genres of film, making a truly original....albeit gruesome....sight to behold.  The cheesy, overdramatic dialogue, overabundance of martial arts, abundance of Asian culture and references, and ridiculously gory final scenes with the battle of the Crazy 88s and O-ren Ishii combined to, surprisingly, make a very entertaining movie.  Kill Bill Volume 2 attempts to go down that same path, but comes up short in a few very important areas.  \"Ah, you can see my foot much better from here!\" Then a flash kick to the face. Truly badass, but short-lived.  If Pai Mei had more scenes, Volume 2 might have been a better flick.  Predominant in the second installment, again, is the parody and references to the major kung-fu and honorable samurai revenge movies of the 1970s. You'll get to see a lot more backstory in this film, including the full tale of how the Bride and her friends were all murdered at the hands of Bill and his assassins.  You'll learn the Bride's real name, Beatrice Kiddo (cheesy, but purposely so).  And we get to see how Bea learned all of that crazy kung-fu skill during flashbacks with her former master, Pai Mei.  In fact, the scenes with Pai Mei are one of the major highlights of the film. The second you see this guy, you'll know he has \"cheesy Chinese master\" written all over him. He actually looks exactly like the generic guru-type martial arts guy from pretty much every kung-fu movie and video game ever created.  His witty, trash-talking personality and awesome stunts during a serious fight make him all the more badass.  But it's all short-lived. Given only about 5 minutes of total screentime, the one character that makes Volume 2 stand out is killed off and written off into the backstory.  What we get for most of the film is a very corny, overdramatic plot that overloads us with details and personal info about the characters that nobody really cares about.  Do I give a shit that Budd has a shitty job at the strip club, and his boss is a dick who makes him clean the toilets?  This has nothing to do with the progression of the film, and unfortunately, you'll see a lot of similar time-killing sideplots that do nothing to enrich the main theme.  A major gripe I have with this film is the directing.  Tarantino likes to give depth to his films, but the amount of, and timing of, the cutscenes and side stories here is unnecessary.  Do we REALLY want to go to a cutscene where Bea learns to break through wood from three inches away, while supposedly in present time, she's buried alive in a coffin?  It would have been nice to see this earlier, and tie it in when she's in that position; but to just throw it in when she's already in a predicament...as if Tarantino thought to himself \"HEY, how can we use a cheesy kung-fu cliche to get her out of THIS ONE? I KNOW, let's have a cutscene with an elder master!\"...is pretty lame, and distracts from the action and suspense of the moment.  By the time we get back to the buried alive scene, we're wondering \"Geez, she's still in there? I hope to god she gets out soon, I guess I'll go take a piss and won't miss anything.\"  In fact, if you take a piss during Kill Bill Volume 2, you probably won't miss anything at all. Unlike the last installment, there aren't any dramatic face-offs or final encounters that are \"can't-miss.\"  The first film slowly built up to a climax, when  the Bride finally took on all of the Crazy 88s and then O-ren Ishii in a very dramatic, ultra-gorey superbrawl.  When you left the theater, you thought to yourself, \"Damn, that was intense. I'm glad I didn't have to take a shit!\"  Wait! It's the beginning of the final kickass swordfight scene we've been waiting for!.......Oh darn, no it isn't. Wake me when it's over.  Volume 2 has no build up to a climax.  There is one decent fight scene with Daryl Hannah, but the end is cut short in a silly way. It's meant to give you a laugh and a shock factor, but it isn't quite as fulfilling as the dramatic finish that we got with O-ren vs. the Bride in Volume 1.  And the final encounter with Bill is laughable. After about 20 minutes of mushiness with her newly-discovered-to-be-alive daughter B.B., there is a lot of talk and reminiscing, followed by a 20 second scuffle with swords against Bill, and then a silly kung-fu \"touch of death\" type finish.  A parody of kung-fu movies, yes, but not very fulfilling in this scene that is meant to be the final climax of action in the movie.  After Bill dies, everything is a happy ending. Hey B.B., I just killed your dad, who raised you for the past 4 years, but MOMMYS BACK so I guess you don't give a shit right? Yeah, makes perfect sense.  The problem with Kill Bill Volume 2 is that it tries too hard to be a silly parody of kung-fu movies. The overdramatic dialogue, and overabundance of backstory and sideplots make this movie a snoozer.  Volume 1 worked because after all the story, came a really kick-ass orgy of violence and gore, leading into a final confrontation with O-ren Ishii.  When the fight finished, you knew the movie was over, and you saw the best part.  The story came packed in with originality in the fight scenes, and the movie had a climax of suspense and action that left you feeling fulfilled.  Kill Bill Volume 2 gives you two hours of boring story that you really don't care about. The story was PURPOSELY made cheesy, so why the hell WOULD I care about it? Despite a few funny moments, a very quick fight with Daryl Hannah, and the interesting character of Pai Mei, the rest of the movie is a snoozefest.  I guess I was supposed to get into these characters and understand/feel for them, but I didn't.  The fact that the movie was supposed to be an amalgamation and a parody of silly martial arts types and anime led me to expect some pretty good suspense and climactic action at the end of the film.  But what we seem to get are all the most boring parts of the kung-fu genre of film, and none of the action or definitive final battle sequences.  If you ask me, Tarantino did a bad editing job with these two flicks. If he had left the O-ren portion for Volume 2, and led up to it with some semi-interesting plot and a few good action sequences in Volume 1, we would have all been happy.  But sadly, the climactic Crazy 88 fight from Volume 1 outshadows anything we see in the second film.  The majority of the audience during this movie actually were GRUNTING and MOANING at the cheesiness of the entire thing, and at the lame ending to the confrontation with Bill. And I don't blame them.  The bottom line: Kill Bill Volume 2 is a good parody of the martial-arts genre of films. The overdramatic dialogue, backstories, flashbacks, and crazy characters (Pai Mei) are all taken directly out of classic kung-fu lore.  But unlike most kung-fu movies, there is no final confrontation or dramatic finish that we're expecting.  All you'll get is a feeling of \"it's over already? Where the hell was the action?\" that Volume 1 never left you with.  It's obvious that Tarantino put too much effort into the first half of this film, and left very little of the good stuff for Volume 2. I guess we all got spoiled a little too soon.  My recommendation? Go buy the Kill Bill Volume 1 DVD in stores now and watch it a few hundred times. At viewing #76, you'll probably finally be bored enough to think that Volume 2 is better than watching the original a 77th time.  Top-Haters.com gives Kill Bill Volume 2 a rating of  Two and a half middle fingers up, for being a decent parody of kung-fu flicks, but not giving us enough action or satisfaction to live up to the first volume.  The Punisher  The original promo shots for the Punisher weren't too promising. Here Jane looks out of place and dorky rather than badass. Luckily they spruced him up a bit in the film.  Marvel's latest offering in the now-all-too-common slew of comic-adapted action movies was set to compete directly with Kill Bill Volume 2. The Punisher stars Thomas Jane as Frank Castle, an ex-undercover cop, counter-terrorist, special forces, yadda yadda yadda, who accidentally gets the son of a prominent Tampa gangster killed during a weapons bust.  In retaliation, John Travolta (the big bad guy) has Frank's entire family slaughtered at a reunion.  Pretty bad luck for Frank having his entire family together at once.  Needless to say, Frank now must go on a rampage, skillfully pitting the gangsters against each other and murdering them one by one, all the while avoiding being assassinated himself.  Along the way, Frank makes friends with a few of the locals in Tampa, including the still-drop-dead-gorgeous Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the floozy Joan, some fat dorky kid, and a druggie-type character with facial piercings. Some of these characters are cliche, but they're interesting nonetheless. Most of the time they give us comic relief, but they also add to the depth of the character of Frank, who appears more as a deeply disturbed human being who is grieving inside at the loss of his family, rather than the ruthless killing machine he ends up being portrayed as in the comics.  NEVER fuck with a man who is good with a crossbow.  If you do, you may end up like many of the gangster-ka-bobs in the Punisher movie.  Where this movie really shines is the original ways that Frank pits his enemies against each other. Rather than just going out and shooting everyone in the head, he sets up Travolta so that he ends up killing his most trusted man, and his wife, accusing them both of cheating.  In reality, Frank made it look that way so that Travolta could know the pain of losing his loved ones, and it being his own fault. Pretty good torture if you ask me.  The plot doesn't try to do anything goofy or off-the-wall. Despite the fact that the story takes place in Tampa, Florida, instead of New York City as in the comics (a weird decision, why the switch?), the story is pretty faithful to the general plotlines of the comic books.  Frank has no superpowers; he's just a REALLY pissed off guy looking to punish those who took away everything he ever had.  Keeping it simple is what makes this movie good.  The acting here is less than stellar, but it gets the job done. Thomas Jane tries to get the silent-but-deadly Punisher act down, but the plot ends up making him look like a softie at heart. It's really hard to figure out how to act here, because the Punisher has ranged from an honorable knight type of guy who always does the right thing, to a ruthless, cold-blooded murderer who will slit your throat if you've so much as stolen a quarter.  So many writers have tackled the Punisher in the comics, it must be hard to know how to be in this role.  But what ends up coming out is a combination of all of these.  Frank helps out his floormates in his apartment building from time to time, and ends up actually getting suckered into a funny dinner with them.  I was actually starting to think that this was going to be a comedy or a softie movie. But the final sequence including carbombs, guns, knives, and many other torturous, merciless ways of killing brought me back to the old comic days of the Punisher.  Travolta does a decent job of playing the villain, but after countless Face-off/Swordfish roles, it just all becomes generic. It gets hard to hate this guy when he seems to be playing the same character in every other movie. Maybe they should pull a Matrix and just make every gangster in every movie from now on have Travolta's face a-la Agent Smith.  At any rate, Mr. Saturday Night Fever does his generic gangster role fine.  Kevin Nash guest-stars as the Russian, a classic Punisher character.  Pretty much impervious to harm, he mops the floor with Frank for about ten minutes until he's finally taken by surprise and beaten by luck.  A major gripe here is that unlike in the comics, the Russian is a silent killer with zero lines.  In the books, he's usually super-talkative, to the point where he becomes dark comic relief while trying to kill Frank.  Kevin Nash does a good job of convincing us this guy is a walking tower of muscle, but don't expect much complexity here.  Hi there! I'm Thomas Jane, you may remember me from such films as Dreamcatcher, where snake-aliens came out of everyone's asses and a retard saved the day.....hey, don't laugh you dicks......SHUT UP and eat lead!  Overall, the Punisher has more similarities to the comic than not, and the ending leaves you feeling fulfilled and satisfied.  Unlike Kill Bill Volume 2, there is actually a fun and suspenseful climax that you expect to be there, and it gives closure to the film.  It's pretty easy to tell that they're setting you up for a Punisher sequel, but I'm not complaining.  With all the Marvel movies out now, it would be pretty fun to see a cross-over type deal with the Punisher having a run-in with Spider-Man or the X-men, and having a tussle because he wants to kill some gangsters, but they won't let him.  The only problem is, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is in like EVERY SINGLE MARVEL MOVIE, so she'd have to play 14 roles in the crossover. Maybe they can have some dumb tie-in that Mystique is actually Joan the floozy or someting.  Anyways...  The bottom line: The Punisher is a decent action flick that, for the most part, is faithful to the comics. Unlike most other comic book movies, you don't have to buy into any superhero-like powers or backstories; Frank is a realistic character who is so pissed off and distraught about losing his family, he snaps and punishes the bad guys.  I'm sure we could all see ourselves in his situation and understand how he reacts and feels.  He's a realistic character that we can all relate to, and that's why seeing him punish the mob gives us a feeling of justice and fulfillment.  The acting is alright, the plot is pretty well written and interesting, and overall the flick ends up being a good time.  Top-Haters.com gives The Punisher  Three and a half middle fingers up  For not butchering the character a-la Dolph Lundgren, and giving us a pretty good action flick.  So, who wins the almighty battle for \"best revenge flick of the season?\"  Oops! I crapped my pants.  VICTOLY!  Despite all the hype, the Punisher delivered where Kill Bill Volume 2 couldn't. If you were to pit Volume 1 against Mr. Castle, I'd say it might go the other way. But as it stands, the Punisher gave us our climax, our conclusion to the film, and a plot that kept our attention. Volume 2 fell short from Volume 1 and left us with a bad taste in our mouths, managing to put us to sleep with boring backstory and an overabundance of ironic Kung-fu cliches, and forgetting about the action that made Volume 1 so successful.  The Punisher clearly stands the victor over the pile of bullet-ridden bodies that would have been Volume 2.  Besides, in a real fight, we all know that Frank Castle would just shoot Uma in the forehead and not think twice.  Good game, bitch.  Check back soon for some ECC9 news. That's all for now.  ~DSP", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: Sunday, August 17 2003  Freddy vs. Jason review; new IRC channel; EVO live updates archived  A few interesting updates today.  First, I just got back from what is probably the most hyped horror movie of all time. This movie is so popular that I showed up a full thirty minutes early Friday night, and it was SOLD OUT all showings. So, my friends and I drove across three or four towns to another movie theater that NEVER sells out in the hopes of seeing it...and it's sold out. Wow.  I showed up really fucking early Saturday night in order to see it, and got my choice of seats.  So, here is the full review (don't worry, there won't be any spoilers about anything cool).  Freddy vs. Jason is one of those movies that you can just go to, sit back, relax, and enjoy. You don't have to think too much (or at all in some cases) because everything unfolds in front of you.  This isn't Matrix: Reloaded where your brain fucking hurts because you're trying to keep up with the plot the first time you see it, and so you miss having \"fun\" watching the film.  In fact, trying to make sense of the plotline deeper than what the film shows you would be pretty dumb.  Come on now, NOTHING in this movie makes any sense: a demon-type guy comes to you in dreams and kills you, while the other guy is some kind of freakish zombie that can't die no matter how many times you blow him up...and when you do, some moron eats his heart and Jason inhabits a new body (go see Jason Goes to Hell if you don't understand that one...I sure as hell don't). SO, trying to throw logic into this film at any point would be a BIG mistake.  Don't try to think back and say \"hey, does this make sense continuing from the last two movies these guys were in blahblahblah.\" If you're thinking about that, you're a faggot. Just sit back and let the movie take you for one hell of a ride.  And what a ride it is. Everything in this movie seems to come together nicely.  Getting the original actors for Freddy and Jason (not the original Jason but the guy who played him in the majority of Friday's) was a HUGE score; this is no cheesy \"Dracula vs. the Wolfman\" from the 1950's where the characters are distorted and made cheesy.  Freddy is here in all his glory, with the catch phrases and awesome, nightmare-ish horror we have come to love.  Jason is still the unstoppable killing machine that has no mercy and DOESN'T TALK (thank GOD I thought for sure they would fuck it up and make him say something stupid).  As for the rest of the cast, well, they're pretty much what you would expect for a horror movie: two central characters who the story revolves around' the token \"black\" person, in this case Kelly Rowland; and a bunch of variety characters including a super-nerd, geek type character, a kid who's brother supposedly committed suicide but was really a victim of Freddy, and the token \"rogue cop\" who believes what the kids have to say and tries to help them.  The really awesome parts of this movie come in the fact that both Freddy and Jason are able to shine on their own, and together.  Both evildoers get to do what they do best, wracking up the headcount and killing a decent number of people; it's shades of their respective movies and you'll love the nostalgia you'll get when you see flashbacks to your fave scenes from the Elm Street and Friday movies.  But the fight scene(s) between Freddy and Jason are ABSOLUTELY POSI-FUCKING-TIVELY AWESOME.  Forget MvC and CvS; THIS is the dream match we've been waiting for for a long fucking time, and boy do we get one hell of a fight.  I'm not going to reveal any details, but let me just say these two guys throw pretty much EVERYTHING into the fight but the kitchen sink, in both the dream world and the real one.  I really enjoyed this fucking movie. The only gripes I have with it really are that there are a few useless characters.  Kelly Rowland really has no role in the movie; she has no love interest, but she seems to just be thrown in as the best friend of the main female character just for the hell of having one of those \"special celebrity guest stars\" in a horror movie.  Also, the nerdy-geek character is pretty boring and doesn't do a hell of a lot of anything in the film.  But everyone else fits in pretty perfectly, for one reason or another.  THE BOTTOM LINE: If you like horror movies...if you have ever been a fan of Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th...if you want to see if the movie \"lives up to the hype\"...or you just want to see one hell of a fight, GO SEE FREDDY VS. JASON. Hell, I might even go to see it again. It's one hell of an asskicking, hack-slashing, tripping ride.  My rating: three out of four middle fingers UP  Now, on to some more news. I've decided to start an official IRC chat for the Top-Haters.  It's on EFNet, and it's called #top-haters.  It's just starting up so it will be small, but in time it will get bigger.

The fact that Nintendo is again padding the game with \"timed map playing\" instead of just letting you play whatever you want is a surefire sign that they know the game is barebones, AGAIN, at launch. And I don't support that kind of sales practice.", "metadata": {"source": "koh_forum", "author": "dsp"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: You've completely missed the point. Just because I already have a Switch and I can buy the game using credit coupons doesn't make this any more viable to play. I will make $0 on any YouTube videos I make of the game, because Nintendo will instantly claim them. Therefore, you're asking me to take several days of playing on a gamble that people watching on stream will actually cheer/sub/tip during those streams and make enough enough money to cover what I'd normally make from BOTH streaming and the YouTube videos. OH YEAH, the month of July has been awful for ad revenue on YouTUbe (traditionally it's the worst month of the year) and I'm already behind on income, plus I just came back from five days off of streaming, so I'm now even further behind.", "metadata": {"source": "koh_forum", "author": "dsp"}}

{"text": "<YCR>: September 17, 2003  FIRST IMPACT NEWS AVAILABLE, OFFICIAL PAGE UP; GUNBOUND IS GOOD FREE FUN; SUPRNOVA DOES IT AGAIN; DON'T LET A GOOD FORUM GO TO WASTE  Not many updates as of late.  Been so busy between the new job, going back to school, cleaning out my harddrive and trying to set shit up (finally got a bank account and fixed my paycheck so I have some cash) I've had little time to work on anything.  But I think there are some important things to take note of, so it's time for an update.  First and foremost, if you'd kindly look over to your left you'll see that work on IMPACT, the new East Coast fighting game major that is to take place in 2004, is well underway.  The preliminary webpage for updates is now up, so go check it out.  Expect updates to be posted as soon as information is made available.  IMPACT is still in the planning stages right now, so don't expect anything super-detailed.  But rest assured more is to come, and we're brainstorming right now and in the process of fundraising.  If you have any good ideas on how to raise money for IMPACT, please go post on the Top Haters Forums in the new IMPACT section, or send me an e-mail at darksydephil@hotmail.com if you have a proposition.  Speaking of the forums, it's come to my attention that very few people are using them.  Over 40 registered members, but nobody posts at all.  I'm hoping that having IMPACT info and discussion on there will spur up some convo, but the situation is just sad.  More than a dozen people asked me for Top-Haters forums, so I gave it to you.  And now, nobody uses them.  The whole idea behind it was that you can say ANYTHING YOU WANT without having to worry about repercussions (UNLIKE another certain Street-Fighter related site which now has so many scrub mods that have nothing to do with the community, I shudder at the thought of it).  So go use it, or I might have to take it down, because it's pretty pointless to maintain a message board that just gathers dust.  Some other people have also asked me what happened to the Broken Joystick webcomics.  Well, to make a long story short, 90% of the feedback I got was negative.  Either 1. the art was shitty (no kidding, I haven't drawn in a decade, it will take me a little while to get my own style back) or 2. the comics weren't funny or didn't make sense, or both.  The funny thing is, I tried to model the comic after other successful webcomics such as Penny Arcade and Player vs Player Online; hell, the punchline delivery, multiple punchlines, and biting sarcasm were almost STOLEN from those strips.  But I guess because I don't draw in an anime or cartoony style good enough for anyone, the strip isn't given a chance.  I dare you to go take a look at the earliest strips of PvP, Penny Arcade, or anything else, because the art is equally shitty on those too.  Only after years of practice and honing their artistic skills did those guys master their own style.  Anyway, considering I got about 1400 insults and 2 complements, the strip is on hiatus.  Whether or not it comes back or not, depends upon whether I get feedback saying that the strip should start up again.  So go post on the forums or e-mail me or hit me up on MIRC and let me know what you think.  Okay, enough about TH.com. Now on to things outside of this small web of influence.  There is a Korean beta of a game called Gunbound that is available for free download.  Go to www.gunbound.net to get it.  The best way to describe the gameplay would be something like a cross between Worms and a Tank-shooting game.  It's multiplayer, it's fun, it has a point ranking system and customizable avatars with accessories you \"earn;\" it's fucking dope for a free game. Best of all, you don't need a godlike computer to run it, and you can play it even if you have 56k (wow!).  So go check it out.  Some of you may have been wondering what happened to Suprnova.org.  Well, to make a long story short, they lost the rites to that domain.  They were using a mirror for a while at elissa.net, but as of this update, www.suprnova.org is back up and running.  A lot of good stuff recently, including the entire Evil Dead Trilogy PLUS the unreleased prequel, Pirates of the Carribean DVD rip, and all 180 episodes of Seinfeld.  Not to mention Knights of the Old Republic, Office 2003 pre-release leak, every episode of the Transformers EVER...it's too much to even mention.  GO CHECK IT OUT NOW!  That's enough of me blabbling for now.  I'll be busy with school and work, so don't expect TOO frequent updates; but I'm not going to neglect the page, so no worries.  I'll also be at the Breaksteak Challenge at 8 on the Break in Dunnellen, New Jersey on September 28, so come check it out and say wassap if  you have nothing better to do that day. Later.  ~DSP  That's it for movies.  In other news, the Top-Haters.com forums that everyone SEEMED to want months ago have been relatively unused.  If nobody uses them soon I'm just going to get rid of them.  The whole purpose was that you guys could say whatever the hell you wanted without the fear of being BANNED a-la Shoryuken.com; so far, nobody has utilized this freedom.  So GO POST YOU FAGS!  On a final note, come back here sometime this week to see some very VERY coveted vids from EVOLUTION 2003...which one's I won't say...let's just say that you want to see them, and they're not exactly supposed to be going around...  That's it for now.  I'm outs.  ~DSP", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: Monday, August 18 2003  Assorted News items; TFGM scandals on SRK; the Cannons like Top-Haters?  DSP here with some more news and updates. First, a correction from my Jason vs. Freddy review: apparently the guy that plays Jason has never played him before, as I suggested in the review. He actually did have a part in other movies, but as extras, a cook, and other minor roles; but he never actually played the role of Jason himself. Honestly I don't give a crap, but after getting lambasted by a bunch of internet geeks who made fun of me on IRC for making such a HUGE error, I figured I should correct myself. I still think the guy did an awesome job...if he didn't, I wouldn't have thought he had experience in the role before.  ---Apparently SRK is being blown up with lots of new threads concerning TFGM, the Empire, and a bunch of other crap. It seems like the more that TFGM and the Empire try to defend themselves, and explain what they are, the worse job they do at achieving their goals. It's hard for me to take a side on this issue.  I've won money from TFGM in a bet at ECC, after beating two Empire Arcadia members in Super Turbo back to back, and TFGM paid up; however, he didn't show up to ECC in person to stand outside for the entire weekend, as was the conditions of the bet.  So I'm kind of 50/50 on the guy. I've spoken to him personally over the internet, and when you actually talk to him normally (and he talks to YOU without all the overdramatic bullcrap he likes to use), he seems like a pretty decent guy.  ...But then I go on SRK and see this guy in a shirt that says EMPEROR down the arm and with a powerglove on, and I'm like.......ugh.  The guy hand a hand in the \"Nestor is off Team East Coast\" in the Marvel 5v5 controversy; he paid off Ricky Ortiz's debt to the Cannons allowing him to participate at EVO (how was this any of his business? shouldn't Ricky pay off his own debts?); he apparently tried to get Josh Wigfall off of the 5v5 team; among numerous other things.  So honestly I don't know what to say about this guy. I'm going to meet him in person and have a discussion with him before I draw any conclusions.  However, I do think that everybody should chill on SRK with the hating. A lot of it is just getting to the point of stupid...senseless and dumb.  All you're doing is making more Empire members like GamingKnight post and make HUGE NOVELS of unintelligible crap that nobody cares about.  If this keeps up I wouldn't be surprised if everybody involved in the Empire threads is banned from SRK.  ...Speaking of being banned, as many of you already know I'm still banned from Shoryuken.com and have been ever since EVO.  I recently got some information that makes the Cannons look like a bunch of hypocrites, and I think its pretty interesting.  ---I was banned from SRK the Thursday of EVO for posting live EVO updates. I was the ONLY PERSON DOING SO at the time. I broke the stories about Sanford getting arrested for jumping an NYC turnstyle, as well as everything that happened in casual play such as Daigo perfecting the best US GGXX player. Unfortunately, some untrue rumors about fights breaking out at EVO also surfaced, and I posted those as well. HOWEVER, I removed such rumors when they were proven to be false.  But that wasn't enough for Ponder (Tony Cannon). He decided to delete BOTH of my threads of live EVO updates.  So, I posted again in the OFFICIAL EVO updates thread and said that \"whoever deleted my threads is gay, because I'm the only person giving live updates, and I'm the first person to break stories like Sanford getting arrested.\" Well, Tony didn't like that, so he banned me from SRK.  I wasn't going to let that stop me from providing the Street Fighter community with live EVO updates, so I used this website as my outlet for news.  I received over 3000 unique hits and 90000 total hits over the course of EVO weekend, so apparently a lot of people used and appreciated my live news feed.  In fact, some people have told me that Top-Haters.com was the best source of information for a tournament EVER and I have received many complements, which I appreciate.  But I was just trying to get the results out ASAP rather than making fellow gamers wonder what the fuck was going on @ EVO...there's nothing worse than wondering wtf is going on at a major you can't attend, but are really interested in the outcomes...and then NOBODY gives results for days and days.  Anyway, you would THINK the story ends there.  But it doesn't.  In fact, it takes a very interesting turn.  Mr. Wizard (aka Joey Cuellar, a mod on SRK and a major organizer for the EVO tournaments) complemented me on Top-Haters as a source of info during EVO.  He went on to say that HE AND THE CANNONS USED TOP HATERS AS A SOURCE OF INFO THEMSELVES DURING EVOLUTION, BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE.  Joey told me that they were not even informed about the \"Pyrolee O.D.ing and leaving in an ambulance\" and \"Shady K getting drunk\" incidences until THEY READ IT ON TOP HATERS.  Can you FUCKING believe that?  The Cannons BAN me from SRK for posting live EVO updates, yet THEY COME TO TOP HATERS THEMSELVES AND READ THE UPDATES ANYWAY.  People have said I can be hypocritical, but GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK HERE.  Thats the most hypocritical thing I've ever heard of in my LIFE: ban somebody from your website for doing something and then go ahead and follow along with them doing it anyway, and then COMPLEMENT THEM on it afterwards.  Gee, maybe I should IP ban the Cannons from Top-Haters to get back at them?  Maybe I should have done that during EVO to make sure their sorry asses couldn't read the updates???  But unfortunately, I'm not a total asshole, and I'm not spiteful. I may be a jokester, and I may do very controversial things like the DEVO trailer, but I don't do the ultimate insult and BAN people from places just because I have the power to...or just because I don't like them.  It's okay to voice your opinion and give them the old FUCK YOU MORON, I don't like you or anything you're doing; but when you start purposely excluding certain people from a major community, that's when the community starts to become elitist.  I did nothing wrong on SRK; no harm was done to anyone because I was posting live EVO updates, the untrue rumors were corrected and everything was cleared up.   But the Cannons unfortunately don't see it that way, and have chosen to sweep me under the carpet rather than deal with the reprecussions of their actions.  Out of sight, out of mind, right? WRONG.  You may not like my eccentric ways, but you have to face the facts that I'm a part of the Street Fighter Community, and I'm not going anywhere. I have helped out at ECC for the past two years, and everyone at the Break knows and respects me.  I still organize and run tournaments in the state of Connecticut.  I personally bought arcade parts such as flat japanese-style buttons for our MvC2 cabs when the arcade wouldn't.  Even though I talk shit a lot, it's just for fun most of the time, and 90% of the people that meet me in person are cool with me...including people on the West Coast that thought I was a total asshole until they met me at SHGL or EVO2k2.  More importantly, I'm involved in the planning for IMPACT, and I'm going to play a major role in its organization and ultimate realization.  I'm probably going to end up doing all of the music and video for the tournament, with a little help from others.  So if you thought I was going away anytime soon, you're wrong.  I could honestly care less that I'm banned from SRK. It's just a hindrance that if I want to find out any real information on tournaments and other events, I have to hide my IP or go on somebody else's computer; but it's not a big deal.  What I find a big deal is that the Cannons think that they're doing the right thing by banning me, when I did nothing wrong.  When you have people like that running the biggest fighting game tournament in US history, people who don't discuss or listen but just throw their power around, that's when you start to have problems. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for the Cannons for doing what they do when they organize EVOLUTION every year; it's a lot of work, time, and money they don't have to put into games, and I think we all appreciate that.  But when you see things like Jason Cole being let into the tournament after his ENTIRE POOL is finished playing, totally ignoring the \"no exceptions\" rule simply because he's a past Super Turbo champion...while meanwhile others are eliminated from tournaments because they were playing in one game while they were called to play in another...When people can start getting banned from Shoryuken.com, the PRIMARY SOURCE of discussion, meeting, information and interaction in the Street Fighter community, because they were posting UPDATES ON THE TOURNAMENT THE CANNONS WERE RUNNING AND WERE GIVING NO INFORMATION ON THEMSELVES...what is next?  When power is thrown around in that unfair manner, and certain people are given favor while others are shitted upon without good reason, you have to realize you will forever have a biased, one-sided view of the Street Fighter community...because those with power simply will make exceptions for those they like, and take exception to shut up those they dislike.  Is that the kind of community YOU want?", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}

I have nobody to lean on to pay my bills, so I absolutely have to make as much money as I possibly can, to keep everything afloat.

Let me take some time to direct you guys to the baddest computer site on the net, TigerDirect.com.  I got all the parts for my comp there and I have no complaints.  Prices are very reasonable too.  If you're looking to upgrade your comp, or just want to build something new, and you don't want to shop all around the net, head over to TigerDirect for a one-stop shopping experience.  Right now I've got my eyes on that Argus 5.0 megapixel digital camera for only $199.  Anyway, since I have a souped up comp now, I've been playing all the latest games. I got Max Payne 2 the day it was released from Suprnova.org...it's alright.  Plot is long, convoluted and....nobody cares.  But the gameplay is pretty decent (albeit repetitive) and the graphical effects are fucking awesome.  Most realistic looking game ever, hands down.  If the game had a little more to it than just \"run in and shoot everyone while using bullettime\" it would probably have a lot more replay value.

{"text": "<YCR>: January 1, 2004  Happy F'ing New Year, you dicks!  I'm back with an interesting, yet brief, New Year's update. Apparently somebody was lonely last night, and sent me an interesting email that goes as follows:  I'm planning on buying a dvd burner and I have a few questions. Btw, I'm using a laptop-Toshiba Satellite 1.6ghz/30GB/256 MB ram, etc.  Circuit City is selling a sony external dvd burner (4x DVDR max, etc.) for about $270 after mail in rebate (originally $300), is that a good deal? I'm assuming sony's products are pretty good and it's at a reasonable price. And Bestbuy sells external dvd burners 4x-DVDR for roughly $300 for most brands (i.e., pioneer, plextor, hp), are these deals legit? What's your expereiences in this field? And is it true that external burners are infamous for being unreliable?  Before I forget again, I just wanna tell you you got one hell of a site there. It's great to have your kind of site around and I loved your take on the srk \"elites\" regarding evo2k3, gotta thank you for that Daigo vs Ricky Ortiz match (but I'll still buy the dvd....probably).  Thanks, P.P.   Thanks, P.P. (interesting choice in names?). I get emails like this every once in a while, and it's nice to know that some people appreciate the time I put into getting an alternative take on the SF scene, as well as a bunch of other stuff.  Now, as for this burner. After a while you're going to realize that pretty much anything that you buy in a retail store is a rip-off. All of the retail stores like Best Buy and Circuit City may have similar external burners for around $300, but by no means does that mean that the burner is worth that much.  If you want to see if a price is reasonable, I recommend going to http://www.pricewatch.com . It's a website that brings together deals from all over the web and compares prices, models, and all around quality. After a brief search on pricewatch, I came up with this:  Sony - External USB2.0/Firewire. Sony DW-U14A. 4X \u00b1 R. DVD X Copy xpress+$20 Details: w. NTI CD/DVD maker 6.5 DVD Authoring/Recordingsoftware & Power DVD 1 free dvd-r. 1 year warranty.  Price: $189, plus $8 shipping.  This is just a little bit cheaper than the aforementioned $270 from Circuit City, and it doesn't even involve a rebate. On top of that, they'll give you DVD XCopy express, the #1 used DVD copying software that gets past ANY copyright protection, for only $20 more. Now keep in mind, this offer is from a retailer called Zeeboo.com that has zero feedback ratings as of yet. If you keep searching, you can find multiple external DVD-burners that are BOTH USB 2.0 and firewire compatible for around $200. And we're not talking super generics here, but name brands.  The fact of the matter is that after just a little searching, you can find pretty much anything for cheaper on the web. The only time you'll find a deal thats worth getting in-store is 1. if you don't want to wait 2 weeks for shipping, or 2. you found a pricematching or rebate deal on an online deals forum like www.fatwallet.com or www.passwird.com .  If you're a smart consumer, you should never, EVER just walk into a retail store and buy something full price.  NOW, as for reliability of external DVD burners:  You have to take into consideration that unlike normal CD burners, DVD burners are pumping massive amounts of highly compressed data through a stream at a high rate of speed (4.7gb of various channels of DVD video, audio etc. in about 15 minutes or so on a 4x burner).  That's enough of a strain when you're going through the IDE feed on an internal DVD drive.  Now, you're going to put the drive on the outside of the computer, and have all of that information travel through a USB cable, through multiple channels of decoding, and finally back through your IDE cable and into your burner. And you're trying to force it to do so at the same speed as an internal DVD burner.  I guess you can see where the trouble comes in. I've heard some horror stories of buffer underruns that have made more than a few new drink coasters out of those expensive DVD-R disks.  What it's really going to come down to is the reliability of the drive that you use, and the software that you use. In a lot of cases, the name brands have nothing to do with quality; I've heard of people spending $300+ bucks on DVD burners like Sony and then have them burn out and/or make countless useless DVDs.  It's really a drive-to-drive thing that's really going to be trial and error, unless you search the web for a place where these drives are rated by reliability.  Anyway, I hope your external DVD-RW drive search comes out well in the end, P.P., and thanks for writing.    I'm off again, for now. By the way, it's now 2004, and for the first time ever I've made a New Years resolution: to concentrate and do extremely well this year in tournaments. This Saturday is a big MvC2/CvS2 tourney at Chinatown Fair, and people are going to be there to challenge me in grudge matches, so I encourage everyone who can make it to come down and watch the first step in retaking my dominating status in the SF world in 2004...the status I gave up after MvC1.  You're either going to learn to respect me, or learn to hate me.  Later.  ~DSP   January 1, 2004  Happy F'ing New Year, you dicks!  I'm back with an interesting, yet brief, New Year's update.

No, but it sure as hell would be a better game if it ran at 60fps. And guess what? Ubisoft AGREES because the PC version DOES run at 60fps! It would be one thing if the game was framelocked at 30fps on ALL versions, but it's not. Therefore, Ubisoft KNEW that 60fps was superior, and gave it to the PC gamers who would complain if they didn't get it; but they blatantly took advantage of console gamers and KNOWINGLY gave them the inferior product, because they don't tend to complain.", "metadata": {"source": "koh_forum", "author": "dsp"}}

{"text": "<YCR>: Saturday, August 23 2003  Mame.dk is back; Awesome PC gamepad discovered; Near-perfect Freddy vs. Jason on torrents; Get Madden NFL 2004 for FREE; Other related news  Sup, I'm back with some new stuff from this week I think is pretty interesting.  -The #1 story this week is that www.mame.dk is BACK! For those of you who don't know, mame.dk is the ultimate source for roms for any form of the Mame emulator.  Want to play some old school Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting? Super Turbo? Alpha 2? Xsf? Mortal Kombat or an old SNK fighter? Maybe you have a taste for some of the classic side-scroller beat em' ups like Captain Commando or the Simpsons?  Or maybe you'd like to get some old-school flavor or the classic shooting games like 1945 Strikers?  Or some wrestling action with WWF Wrestlefest or Saturday Night Slammasters?  Mame.dk has it ALL, including clones of all the games for the Japanese, Asian, European, and US territories.  That means that games likes Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter will have a version there that allows you to play as Norimaru, the Japanese-version-only character.  Mame.dk is basically THE site for arcade emulation on the internet.  The site actually went down a few months ago, due to lack of funds and excessive bandwidth, but just this week they came back with all of their ROMS fully intact. I suggest any serious gamer go check it out; but be warned, unless you physically own the game board (like I do with XSF and ST) then you're BREAKING THE LAW by downloading the roms.  So be careful.  -Since I was busy testing out lots of games this week, I felt I should go out and get a new gamepad.  I headed over to Circuit City and found this really cheap-looking one for $9.99 called the Saitek P220.  Why did I go so cheap?  I've tried out pretty much every single PC gamepad over the years, and to be honest, they're all trash.  Either 1. the d-pad itself is trash (Microsoft Sidewinder, Logitech Wingman pads, Thrustmaster pads), or 2. the buttons are just absolutely horrid to play with (Logitech pads, Thrustmaster, some of those horrible pads with arrow-type buttons, wtf are those?), or 3. the pads simply fall apart with normal usage (Interact Propad 6, the old 3dfx/Interact Sharkpads or whatever they were), or 4. the pads are erratic in usage no matter what you do, either with the d-pad or the usage of the buttons (Propad 6 sometimes jumps around no matter what you do; Gravis gamepad buttons for some reason refuse to work together when pressed simultaneously, so good luck playing VS-series games with them).  So I grabbed this cheap-looking Saitek P220 digital pad and gave it a shot.  Make no mistake, the thing is VERY ugly looking; its some unflattering shade of green, with a silver, rounded-off style d-pad and six silverish buttons on the front, with a throttle button where the start button should be, and two trigger buttons on the shoulders of the pad.  I didn't expect much, especially because I'd never heard of Saitek before.  Well, was I ever surprised.  I quickly put in one of the hardest games to control because it's so fast paced: Xmen vs Street Fighter.  I immediately realized that I could do ALL of my infinites, including ones like Magneto's in the corner with repeated hyper gravs.  Then I realized I could airdash and wavedash with the greatest of ease, and all of Zangief's spinning lariats came out as well.  The real coupe de gras came when I was getting spinning piledrivers with Gief like nothing.  I quickly booted up King of Fighters 2002 to make sure I wasn't dreaming; but all of those hard-to-do \"half circle forward, quarter-circle backward plus two button supers\" came out fine.  I also played with several charge characters like Blanka and Guile and found that everything worked as well.  A bonus feature of this pad is that it's USB, not gameport, so you can hook four of these babies up to your comp and have some crazy battles in some of your favorite classic games.  Also, it's only ten bucks, so you won't break the bank on some of these overly-expensive, pretty-looking pads with stupid features like rumble that nobody needs.  On top of all that, the Saitek P220 is plug-and-play; there are NO DRIVERS REQUIRED as long as you're using a newer operating system like WinXP or 2000.  So it's easy as all hell to get your game on with this thing.  To be totally honest, as far as gamepads go, the Saitek P220 Digital Pad is as good as, if not better than, the best gamepad to ever be on the market, the Japanese-style Sega Saturn pad...the only difference is, the P220 is UGLAY!  Just keep at eye out, because there's also another Saitek pad that has analog control and goes for about $10 more than the P220; unless you play emulated PSX games that need analog control, that's just a waste of cash.  SO, if you're a serious Kaillera warrior or just getting into game emulation, and you're looking for some awesome controls at a VERY affordable price, check out the Saitek P200 Digital Pad.  I give it four out of four middle-fingers up!  and that's pretty damned good!  -On a quick side note, I found an extremely good cam copy of Freddy vs. Jason on torrents this week by DaDuck.  It's a telesync, which means the guy had a cam in the theater; but I'm telling you, the quality is pretty damned good. If you can deal with a little bit of echo in the sound, then you should get this movie, especially if you saw Freddy vs. Jason already and you just want to check it out again. But I IMPLORE you to go see this movie in the theaters before you download the torrents version, because this movie is absolutely excellent, and you need to see it in a theater and support the moviemakers who put their time and effort into it.  To see the excellent torrents version, go to www.suprnova.org and look for the version by DaDuck that is telesync.  By the way, Suprnova is an EXCELLENT site for torrents, including games, movies, programs and music.  Just keep in mind you need to find the BitTorrent program first before you can use the files on suprnova.  -Also on Suprnova is probably the most-downloaded item of the week: Madden NFL 2004 for the PC.  This version is basically the official CDs just ripped and made into .bin and .cue files.  Download the version that has both CDs together (it will be over 1000mb) and then burn the .bins to CD using Nero or a similar burning program.  Then do a full install and use a dummy cd key; they are floating all over the internet, but for legal reasons I'm not going to post any of them up here.  The reason I support Madden being hacked like this is because you only get to play it on the internet for 14 days; then you have to PAY to do so. What the hell?  Why do PS2 players get free unlimited games, but PC gamers have to pay?  It doesn't seem to make much sense. However, you CAN do a direct connect to somebody's IP address for free, and unlimited times.  So I suggest you get your buddies to download the game, and just take turns hosting and connecting to each other.  If you're looking for someone else who has the PC version and want to get a few games in, you can always go to #madden or #0wned on EFNET of MIRC and you'll probably find somebody.  Oh yeah, I recommend the Gravis Gamepad Pro for controlling Madden 2004, because it looks exactly like a PS2 gamepad, so you can set up the buttons to the PS2 settings, and that way you get used to that button configuration, and can go kick your friend's asses at their house when you go over and play it on PS2.  -That's pretty much all the news for this week.  Just remember, www.mame.dk and www.suprnova.org for all of your cheapskate needs; if you're poor like me, you need to take what you can get.  Just BE CAREFUL and don't get caught out using Kazaa or something and tell the RIAA you heard it here, because then I'll have to hurt you.", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}

To completely refill that bar from the start multiple times is an insanely poorly thought out choice, and the fact it wasn't removed in another version of the game proves it wasn't a bug.

Quarter points allow me to differentiate between games that may be close in quality but have small factors setting them apart. Giving two games an 8 when I slightly liked one more than the other wouldn't be fair. Lots of reviewers use too broad a scale, leading to their scores not being scaled properly (I really liked this game but it's a 7.5, but this game sucked and it's a 7, for example; I've seen this TONS of times at IGN, sadly).

{"text": "<YCR>: January 4, 2004  DSP Triumphant; Top-Haters 2, Empire 0  For the second time in a year, I've beaten the Empire at their own game. And hopefully I've earned myself some well-earned respect in the community.  How did it all start?  With this thread: http://www.shoryuken.com/forums/thread49975.php  Titled \"Blaze Asks Em: Up and Comers 2004,\" Blaziniflo decided to make a list of the players he decided would be the \"up and coming MvC2 players\" for the new year.  And it just so happens that a few of those players, namely Javier \"Khameleon\" and Mike \"Infinite\" from NYC, I've beaten before in tournament, and also recently in several games on a side bet at the Break.  SO I brought it upon myself to ask Blaziniflo why he mentions these players that I've beaten before, giving them respect and name-drops, while meanwhile NOBODY gives me respect as a serious player.  Indeed, whenever anyone mentions top players on the East Coast, my name never really comes to mind. Despite the fact that I've beaten some of the best there is in tournament, including Josh Wong, Javier, Bryheem Keyes, Julian Robinson, Josh Wigfall, and several others that are all considered to be good players, and respected on the East Coast as well as SRK.  Maybe it's because I come from a state that was never good at anything besides MvC1.  Maybe it's because I don't hang with the CTF or Philly or Jersey crews that are more mainstream. Maybe it's just because I talk a lot of shit and people don't like me because I have some fucking testicles between my legs. Or maybe it's because Shady K beat me one game with Omega Red.  I don't give a fuck.  All I know is, you're all going to learn to respect me, or hate me.  Javier and Infinite didn't like my mentioning that they lost to me on a few occasions. So they felt the need to talk shit.  So, we had a little grudge match tonight. Me vs Infinite, first to 10 wins for $50.  The games went 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, and then 5-5 tie.  Then Infinite won 4 straight, making the score 9-5.  Then I looked around. I saw Desmond, Matrix, TFGM, and others in the Empire all happy, coaching Infinite during the matches, talking about him beasting on me and blah blah blah. And that's when I snapped.  And I won the grudge match 10-9.  Then I beat Matrix 5-2 for $25.  And then I played Desmond after 90 minutes of constant play and over 25 straight games of high level MvC2 play, and lost 3-5.  Any of you that say my victories are a fluke....  Any of you that say I'm a scrub and a lucky bastard.....  All of you who refuse to give me even a shred of credit for my skill, despite the fact that I live in a state with next to no competition and no working arcade controls anywhere in sight...  You can now all officially suck my dick.  For full tourney details, go here: http://www.shoryuken.com/forums/thread50589.php  And if you want to see some vids from the tournament, including my matches vs Infinite and the Sanford vs Desmond matches from the tournament that were absolutely fucking awesome...  They'll be up within a day.  This is just the beginning.  ~DSP", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: March 4, 2004  Breakdown results; HUGE MWC bet!; My proposition ...   Sup! Been a while since I updated. Honestly hasn't been much to talk about as of late.  But now, there is a lot to talk about.  First, let's discuss the results of the Breakdown, the tournament at the Break last weekend.  -Sanford and Justin have the closest MvC2 finals ever. Goes down to the last game of the last set and results in Sanford making one mistake, and Justin teching out of a throw that would have killed him if he didn't. Amazing level of play and I feel like I got better at Marvel just watching it.  -Jeron beats me in ST tournament. Now both Justin and Jeron, relatively new ST players, have beaten me in ST tourney. Hurray. Yes, I suck. If I had half a brain I would counter-team and beat Jeron , but instead I decide to be a man and try to beat his Vega with O.Sagat twice. GGPO.  -I go out in 2 in the MvC2 tournament. First time ever? I think so. I lost to Eddie Lee and Smoothviper (again). But I've never done well in tourney so I guess it's no big deal.  -In the highly hyped triple-threat grudge match, Infinite beats both me and Shawn Morgan. I put in a shitload of practice for this match, only to eat random Cable grenades when I can't superjump properly on Break sticks. Shawn also complains about controls and leaves after his loss. But Infinite beat us, so he deserves my respect. I don't know how top players can play on a variety of controls, because I've never been able to. I guess I just need more practice.  -In the MvC2 team tournament, I run through Josh Wong's team (again), I beat Eddie Lee (revenge for MvC2 regular tourney) and I OCV Josh Wigfall in my most impressive performance since I beat Infinite in the grudge match last month. Does it mean anything besides I'm a lucky bastard? Who knows.  In other news, TFGM of Empire Arcadia is supposedly making a HUGE bet with Mike Watson, an OG ST player.  At Midwest Championships, Mike Watson will take on a team of Empire's best ST players, including Justin Wong, Julian Robinson, Flash G, Arturo, and Jeron. The bet is for 100 games; Mike will play each member of team Empire 20 games. If the Empire wins 10 games out of the 100, Empire gets $2000 from Watson. If Empire fails to do so, TFGM pays Watson $5000! This is the single hugest money bet ever proposed in SF history! Surely worth the plane ticket to MWC. Get your ass there if you get the chance.  Final news item relates to ECC. Apparently a lot of people are talking smack online, saying that the WC ain't shit, and the Empire does not represent the EC in fulll. I don't know. I don't know who is coming to ECC from the WC. I know that ECC is going to be HOT HOT HOT this year, for sure. But I have proposition.......  ......a rematch of the 5v5 MvC2 grudge match from EVO last year.........  ......but different.......  ..........but I'll announce details later.  God I'm an annoying bastard.  Soon!  ~DSP", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}

It's a major issue and the primary reason I left the website in 2014. Finally, Twitch subs were nice but never much in regards to income; even when they were at their highest, they didn't touch what I'm raising on Patreon.

They DO NOT give you enough hours to qualify for healthcare (even less so since Obamacare went into effect) and constantly fluctuate schedules to 1. fit their own needs despite what you might tell them up-front about your availability and 2. keep it so you're under the required amount of hours to get healthcare, to keep their own costs down. I seriously have no idea where you think entry-level part-time jobs are just handing out healthcare, because they're not; they're relying on Obamacare to take up the reigns for them. Now if someone worked one of those jobs and worked up to a more stable position (i.e. full time) THEN you'd qualify for health care.

Yes, of course I sometimes brought up doing Smark Guys or something else because that was when we had our best times. I was friends with John, but we mainly interacted during the days when he was visiting so we could record/stream. We didn't have any kind of personal relationship outside of those kinds of days, although we always talked a lot off camera about personal stuff.

I dunno, I don't know a single person outside of these guys who isn't okay with texting as a form of communication in the modern era.

{"text": "<YCR>: Ok I just spent about 2 hours playing with the shotokan-type characters (ryu, ken, sagat, akuma, dan). At first they seemed to suck bigtime. Fireballs do rediculously little damage, dragon-punches have pitifully bad priority, and super moves are almost pointless. But I experimented and found how to use them effectively. So here's what I came up with:  Sagat Best mode: V-ism Why: In V-ism Sagat has alternate punches by holding forward or backward and pressing strong or fierce. The strong is ok for trading ground hits and just plain looks nice. But I like the new fierce punch. It is a standing uppercut that is soooooo great, ESPECIALLY against Vega, because it has such great priority over everything else. It will knock him out of the air almost every time! Vega players beware, your weakness has been found! And if you activate the pseudo-custom combo (I like the fastest one the best, activated with Fierce and Roundhouse) he can do repeated tiger knees to juggle the opponent into the corner, then keep using tiger blows to rack up massive hits and damage. Or just stay away and throw random high/low tiger shots, and his shadows will throw extra ones that confuse the opponent.  Ryu Best mode: X-ism Why: X-ism Ryu can do massive damage with just a few hits. His jumping in roundhouse->crouching forward->fireball combo does over 25% damage. His super vacuum-fireball does decent damage if blocked or if it connects (which it constantly does surprisingly, it goes through almost every other move in the game!). And in this mode the Shoryuken has higher priority than the others. Finally, by holding forward and pressing fierce, Ryu can do a 2-hit elbow thrust that not only looks nice but is fast and can take many an opponent by surprise.  Ken Best mode: ???? Why: Well, where do I begin? Since the shinryuken is now useless because the vacuum has been removed, A-ism sucks. X-ism isn't much better either, though it is a little because Ken does a little bit more damage with his moves. But his shoryu-reppa just sucks cuz it's slow and predictable, and even if the first hit connects, most of the time the opponent can block the rest for some strange reason. So probably it's a tie between X and V-ism. I can't comment on V-ism combos though cuz i didn't use Ken in that mode much.  Akuma Best mode: A-ism Why: Diversity. Plain and simple. Akuma's hurricane kick/uppercut juggles are great, and it's nice to have super air and ground fireballs too (though like i said they hardly do any damage). And his shoryu-reppa is better than Ken's cuz it's just a little more damaging. Besides, X-ism totally sucks cuz his super is the raging demon, which is hard to get to connect.  Dan Best mode: A-ism Why: His super fireball is cool but does as little damage as ever. However, his level 3 super combo (can't recall the name, but the one where he stands still and does all those kicks/punches/uppercut at the end) suprisingly has a vacuum now and is a great move to use. Plus it is very damaging to boot! Also try his level 3 super taunt which turns every move he does into a taunt! Coolness redefined.  Whew, anyways those are my opinions. I hope I helped out somebody that at first thought these guys sucked bigtime. SF Forever!!!!!!!!!!!!", "metadata": {"source": "SF2 Google group", "author": "WhoaMoses, Darksyde"}}

(except for the stupid supers which nobody cares about anyway) I mean we've waited years to play them again and they're still the same! And what's up with Blanka? They should have kept his supers from EX2 instead of taking them away and giving him that predictable vega-like ceiling jump super crap. I mean this is just rediculous!

{"text": "<YCR>: Ok let's get something straight: these secret characters are not, CANNOT be from the EX series. Why? Because Arika owns them, not Capcom! Arika bought a license to use SF characters in their 3D fighting games, but Capcom does not own the rights to any original EX characters. And I really doubt that Capcom will go through the trouble of buying a license to use Arika characters when they can use Dee Jay, Fei Long, T.Hawk, Guile (but it doesn't look like he's one of 'em dammit), and Evil Ryu. I just can't believe that Shadaloo Bison isn't going to be selectable! I wanted to use that cheesy Shadaloo-psycho crusher too.  Anyways, it seems likely that the secret characters will also not be from SF3. Why? Because Capcom wouldn't go through the trouble of redrawing the sprites from that practically-new game, and the existing sprites can't be converted because of the amazingly high frame rate of the CPS3 engine (alpha 3 STILL runs on a CPS2). So give up on SF3 characters too.  Sorry to burst your bubbles guys. But the truth must be told. You really shouldn't be getting your hopes up about these characters that couldn't possibly be in the game anyway. And so what if there are 5 new characters? We all know that Vega is still going to be way overpowered over everybody else and a bitch to beat no matter who you play. And another thing: this is the Alpha series, not the original SF2 series. My point? Any returning characters will have piss-poor damage. The massive 1/4 of your energy damage from just tapping the edge of Fei Long's flaming dragon kick will probably be reduced to a mere sliver of hurt. And I'm also sure that Capcom will fuck with the priority of the moves too. Let's be honest, do you really think that any anti-air move that a character does will out-priorize a Vega wall-drop from directly overhead? I didn't think so.  Ok, the damage is done.

{"text": "<YCR>: Okays guys, enough. This rivalry has gone on long enough. How about this: let's discuss the players who are really good and why they are good. Why is Valle so good? Probably because he spends his whole life in the arcade at Sunnyvale or at tournaments. I'd really love to know how these guys support themselves. Do they have jobs? Do they go to college? Did they ever even graduate from high school? Who knows. I honestly want an answer. I just can't believe that these guys, east or west coast (okay so most of them are west coast) are just BETTER than everybody else. There has to be a reason. And I'm betting that that reason is because these guys have no life outside of a video arcade. I'm not one to brag: I'm good at capcom games but I get beaten too. I think that I can honestly say that I'm one of the best in southern Connecticut (along with Tee Carter, we're longtime rivals), but I'm sorry to say that I'm only a high school student who has more important things on his mind that traveling the country to go to tournaments where I can have the priviledge to play guys who's life is Street Fighter 24-7. Obviously I'll get schooled and be ashamed of my pitiful skills. But I'd rather go to a good college, get a good-paying job, and raise a family than be a veritable Ryu, wandering from place to place just to win tournaments to make enough money to live. Let's smarten up guys: Street Fighter IS NOT a way of life like a lot of people make it out to be. It's just a fun game that is meant to be played on the side, while things like school, jobs, and family come first.  And by the way, I have played Valle once in KOF97 when I went to Sunnyvale a few years ago. Of course he kicked my ass. He'd probably been playing the game for a month before me (it was my first time playing). But it was pitiful that he was soooo good in such a short time. I'm willing to bet he spent like the whole entire week it came out in the arcade just to find out the most powerful characters (can you say Benimaru?) and whoop all the competition from here to oblivion like he did to me.  So once again, I'm sorry to bust all you guys balls, but wisen up. Street Fighter is not some great big sports competition with a East coast-West coast rivaly. It is only a game. And those like Valle who are supposedly SO good at it that they are unbeatable are just sad little kids who haven't grown up yet.  And by the way, somebody tell Valle that I posted this, cuz I want a response from him.  Nuff' said.  (By the way, I AM the undisputed champion of Tekken 3 on the East coast. If anybody thinks otherwise, come down to old What's Your Game? Arcade in Bridgeport on a Friday or Saturday night and I'll show you a thing or two. That is if I'm working (that's right guys, I have a J-O-B!)", "metadata": {"source": "SF2 Google group", "author": "WhoaMoses, Darksyde"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: Okay, so maybe this post seemed like it was focus primarily at Alex. I didn't mean it to be. I just meant to use Alex as a representation of ALL the so-called SF gurus out there, particularly on the west coast.   Okay, so maybe I'm making assumptions. But I didn't say that I was right in the first place. That's why right at the beginning I asked for someone like Valle to respond to see just why these guys are so good in the first place. I still believe that these guys play the games a hell of a lot more than me and that's why they're better. Then I get to go online and hear all about the \"SF gods\" who are so good. And I think to myself \"Hey, I could probably as good as them if I had the time to spent on it. But I don't, and it's no big deal.\" And the East Coast getting the games later than the West Coast is probably a buncha bull, I agree. Of course I'm sure Valle beat me at KOF97 cuz I'd never played the game before, and he had already mastered Benimaru. Man did that lighting fist corner trap piss me off...... However, you have to agree that when the east coast NEVER gets games (I've never seen a KOF98 machine, and the only place I've heard of it over here is at Chinatown fair in NY), we can't exactly stand much of a chance.    Now YOU'RE making the assumptions. You're basically saying that I was wasting my money by playing him because he would have beaten me no matter what the circumstances (sounds like a classic case of Valle worhip to me!). Well I woulda LOVED to see him beat my Ralf or Terry with somebody like Cheng......now THAT woulda been frickin hilarious. I'm sorry, but I just do not believe that somebody can be \"naturally\" good at games, or that the \"force\" is with him. That's just a buncha crap. That case may be so in sports (some people are more muscular, or just better athletically built than others, and so are naturally better) but no way is it so in video games. I will never dunk on Jordan, but it is possible for me to beat Valle at SF. That's because anybody can learn to hone and refine their minds and reflexes. And now we're getting into philosophy and I'm getting a headache......   I'm not making excuses. I'm just trying to understand why people worship these guys, and why there's an East-West rivalry. It's really no big deal, just a game.   If he did post, he'd probably just swear at me for callin him a little kid and threaten my life.......a typical response to any threat. And this isn't a childish tirade either, it's a legitimate argument. Like I already said, I didn't know if I was right or not about it, I just wanted an answer from somebody who knew these guys, or from the guys themselves. Thanks for actually posting in response.   Not really. You obviously didn't realize that I was being sarcastic (then again who can tell when you can't hear the person's voice? I'm pretty stupid ain't I). Anyways, I am pretty good at Tekken 3, but I know I'm not the best. There's always somebody out there who can beat you......and that's why neither Valle or Choi or even Viscant (uh-oh, what have I started?) can be the undisputed US champion of anything. After all, none of them have played me. So there!  (Just on the side, does anybody know if Valle works at Golfland, or used to? Cuz when I went it looked like he worked there and at first I didn't recoginze him.

{"text": "<YCR>: Allow me to present a revolutionary idea into the board: why do people play Alpha3? Allow me to explain. I hate the game. Why? It's too gimmicky for me.  Why the need for -isms? Because it's an attempt by Capcom to make the game seen more interesting. It doesn't work. The game is still horribly slow to play, and just plain boring. As always, some characters are rediculously overpowered in the hands of skilled players. And now the people have finally realized the true  potential of the all-powerful V-ism combo. I knew this was coming. It's just a repeat of the CC crazyness of A2. After people started decimating me when I  realized I couldn't stand up, and it was unavoidable when I was too close, I hated the game. I mean, why????? WHY???? Why do we need these stupid \"new combo systems?\" They are useless. The best Alpha in my opinion was A1. Yes, A1, the  forgotten one. Why? Capcom introduced chain combos. These took skill to execute and added a whole new side to the game. But they were avoidable. To this day I refuse to use Custom Combos in A2 and V-ism combos in A3. They are just utter  trash added to appease us for an otherwise boring game with nothing really new to give us. Sorry, I'd rather get my butt kicked with a punch-kick combo by Ken than by his 15 shadows.  Now allow me to name some games I like: the VS. series. Oh no, I've done it now! Am I completely mad?????? Not really. Am I a scrub? Hardly. Then why do I  like these games with infinites and 60% plus damage and button-mashing? Because it's FUN. Yes, I said FUN. Whoa, what a new concept. Fun is what video GAMES  are all about. The VS. games aren't like A3. Here's a typical A3 match:\" Wow. One guy is gonna use Rolento and use the Rolento pattern, and another guy's gonna use Ken and use the Ken pattern, and they're gonna duke it out in super slow-mo until one of them messes up and eats a 50% V-ism combo. Wow.\" Now  here's a typical MvsC match: Wow. One guy is gonna use Strider and Chun-Li and use the typical patters, etc. But what about the helpers? A well-timed Colossus will fuck up any pattern you have. You can roll out of almost anything and  effectively retaliate even if the opponent executes a combo correctly. So there's always excitement and fun. Sure the game is horribly unbalanced....but is it? Any character, if played effectively, can defeat any other character. Can anybody tell me Hulk's 60% corner combo of doom? No? That's because I've only gotten it to work once. How about Gief's zany teleport punch? Or a well-timed super charging star totally eating up Strider's Oroborous? These are once-in-a-lifetime things. You never know what's gonna happen when you play  MvsC cuz the game just has so many factors to consider. And sure you can argue that there's infinites. Well here's what I say: SCREW THEM. Where I live nobody knows them but me, so it doesn't really matter. We all get together weekly to have a hell of a lot of fun playing an unpredictable game called MvsC......rather than an utterly predictable, slow, and boring one named A3.

{"text": "<YCR>: Okay, so I over did it a little. Okay, a LOT. I was making assumptions that I couldn't back up. It just gets a tad annoying when there's this whole East-West coast rivalry thing that's so stupid to begin with, and then I have to read all these arrogant bastards on the West coast saying they're just good, period.......I'd like to apologize to Valle (tho he probably didn't read the thread anyway) if it seems like I was making a personal attack on him. I shouldn't have used his name, but been more general. I was just wondering if these so called \"pros\" played a hell of a lot of SF to get that good, is all. But I went overboard, and accused Valle of having no life and playing games 24/7. Oh well. We all have our bad days.  HOWEVER.........  I'm sorry guys but my belief that MvsC is more fun to play than A3 sticks. That's right. I never said that MvsC had a better fighting engine, or that it was a better game overall. I said that A3 is too slow (maybe my machine is set really slow, or maybe I'm just used to the versus series, but it's just SLOW around here) and that VCs are trash. And I still believe I'm right. If the game was just A(Z) and X-ism, and a little faster, I might like it more. But I'm sorry, this game is just too boring for me to play. I played it for a month after it came out and soon realized that I could decimate any opponent with No-ism Zangief. Then somebody actually figured out how to beat me, and I switched to X-ism Dhalsim. After a week or two that got old and I picked Rolento, then Karin, then Rose (who is highly underrated, if you ask me).....then I even got desperate and played as the shotos....then the novelty ran out. I'm just plain bored whenever I play that game. It's too highly dependent on previously planned-out matches. And once I'd found out they ruined the Alpha Counters.......well that was the last straw, so to speak. MvsC is just more fun. It's more dependent on spur-of-the-moment thinking. Some of you have argued that if you use a certain pattern with characters like Wolverine, Chun-Li, or Strider, that you'll always win. Not so. In theory you're right, but this is real life. People make mistakes. Controls mess up. Shit happens. And it'll be that one second that you make a mistake that I'll take control. And then you can kiss your beloved two tokens goodbye...... And as for infinites.......I already explained that nobody around here knows how to use them but me, right? Well yeah the competition does mainly consist of scrubs. But there are a few decent players. And why don't I use the infinites to win every time? Because that just wouldn't be FUN. F-U-N. I'd rather have to use three combos to defeat my opponent than one unescapable one. Because ya see, video games are becoming a lot like professional sports. It used to be for the love of the game. Now it's just to be \"the big shot\" who can beat everybody. Well for those of you out there like that, I say SCREW YOU. We don't need your kind around our machines. Some people just wanna have fun. Go play baseball or something you losers. Use some skill for a change, learn how to play the game, or go home. Also there's a big difference between throwing and infinites.....namely, throws are escapable, and throws don't kill you instantly. So there. Personally I love throwing, and believe it or not I take a lot of shit about it. Maybe next time a scrub complains about me throwing him, I'll use an infinite? Maybe then he'll be happy.  So that's how I feel. This is my personal opinion. I never said any of this was fact in the first place, just my belief that MvsC was more fun to play, and therefore a better GAME overall, than A3. Because games are judged not by how hard they are to play, or how much skill they take, but by how much fun you have while playing them. And I knew that by going against popular opinion and not conforming to what the common video gamer believes, I was gonna take a lot of shit. And I did (13 posts of it actually). And that's okay, because nothing that anybody says will ever change my opinion. Call me a scrub. Call me a loser. Call me too lazy to play A3 every weekend and master all the characters.

How dare you use that bull$hit on me you biotch!\" You may not want to do that unless the person is a close friend or you want to start a small riot. However, it is okay to vent some frustration at the game. E.G. \"Stupid piece of $hit! I pressed the buttons! I moved the joystick! And I still lost?!??!!?!\" It's preferable to say something stupid or comical so that people don't think you're a mentalcase.

Don't put soda or food or anything on top of the game!

I've debated this before on this board about a month ago, and got flamed for it. But I'm sorry, I stand in my beliefs. Does anybody know what the word \"game\" means? Well here's the official definition according to Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (for all you guys in college): \"game, n., activity engaged in for diversion or amusement : PLAY.\" So that means that a \"game\" is BETTER if it's more fun to play, right? RIGHT! That's the whole purpose of a game! I dunno where this whole idea of a game being better cuz it takes more skill to play came from. Games are better if they are more fun to play......and I'm sorry for not being a \"hardcore\" SFer but MvsC is just more fun to play. It brings people, who are both good and bad at the game, together. And it's as fair as any other Capcom game: if you know what you're doing, no scrub will ever defeat you. So stop the whining about the learning curve being so small, okay? That's irrelevant. I admit that A3 takes more skill to learn and to play, but so what? The game isn't as fun as MvsC. There isn't ever as much competition, and the game just gets boring after a while. Sure u can argue that certain characters (Chun-Li, Strider, Wolverine, etc.) dominate the game, but the same goes for any fighting game (maybe excluding KOF97 which was pretty balanced overall if u knew how to play it). If you get bored with playing as the dominant characters, then get some guts and pick Jin or Morrigan or someone else.....after all, it would take more SKILL to win with them, right? And since u love skill so much......  Now I made you look stupid didn't I?

I would have suggested trying an airborne Judgement Day after the OTG short, but he can't do any special moves at that point. Um....I think the only other thing you can do is an OTG forward, standing forward, which looks pretty sick, but doesn't do a heck of a lot. Blackheart is definitely a limited character.    Yes, it has to OTG, because he's too slow for another inferno to come out before they hit the ground from the first. The only problem is, most people roll after the first inferno, and so if you go for the second and they roll, you're combo bait.   You can go for anything you want after the second inferno. It might not necessarily hit....   Don't try to combo it, you can't. It's strickly a keep-away move, and is a lot more useful when Blackheart is used as a helper character than when he's the tagged-in fighter. Don't use it, stick strictly to keep-away moves like standing forward and tick-damage moves like the jumping judgement day.   Nope, like I already said, the standing Roundhouse never combos for some reason.....it kinda ruins the fun of it.   Not really.

{"text": "<YCR>: All I have to say is...ouch. Mokoto kicks ass. Not because of great combos or supers or anything.... it's because of her crouching forward kick. That thing cancels out just about EVERY SINGLE other normal in the game, and takes out just about EVERY SINGLE jumping attack too. She totally eats up opposition because all of their footgames are useless. The ONLY way I could beat her (of course I mean somebody who was really good with her) was to pick Hugo and get lucky 360 throws off, taking massive damage. Otherwise, how can you ever beat her? Here is the only strategy you need to win: Stay away at all times when possible! When the opponent comes in for the attack: If they jump in, use a crouching forward, or if they're going for an overhead, her d, df, d + punch move. If they dash in or walk in for a ground attack, just keep doing well timed low forwards. It stops every ground game there is, and even stops the strong+forward overhead. Fireballs? Come on! This is SF3 man, just parry!  Guess what? You just got yourself invincible defense. The crouching forward just has too much priority. And if you're an aggressive player, and can't resist attacking, you can do an occasional dashing punch to catch them offguard. And if they ever do happen to get close enough to hit you, you can use the punch super (you know, the one where she punches you a lot of times and you go flying) to knock them back and take massive damage as well.

{"text": "<YCR>: It doesn't, at least not for long. Besides, if you're facing a good GWM player, he'll be on the way up (jumping) since GWM is best played in the air. So the most I ever get out of a Collosus is one or two hits....then he continues jumping up. However... I did find a good use for Collosus. As soon as they go for the dual attack, block as the other WM comes out, then call out the helper. Usually if it's regular WM, they'll go for a low sweep to try to combo you into countless War Destroyers....so this totally takes them off guard. If it's GWM, well, he's stuck in hit stun anyway. So if you have Chun-Li, go for the Kikosho and take lots of damage off of the War Machine closest to you. The only disadvantage is that sometimes the other War Machine blocks, or already had the War Destroyer going, and you end up taking some damage. But it's a small price to pay for taking 1/2 of a War Machine's life, right?   I'll try it....but I think I've tried this before. The problem is that GWM can just use that damned jumping Fierce Punch and hit you even after the stomp-into-RH.  you won't take any damage either since the ball of energy protects both Chun-Li and her partner from say war destroyers.  This is NOT necessarily true. If they block right after they activate the dual attack (if it's regular War Machine, that is) and you do your two-on-one, you'll be wide open for major damage. This strategy will only work if it's GWM that's coming out, and if you're playing on a machine that's good enough to get two-on-ones every time. The ones that I play on usually switch characters by accident (arg!).   Oh sure, of course I have to play against Rob Aponte, who won 2nd at ECC4. Oh well....we just had a local tourney and I got 2nd (Rob got first but we both fought down to the wire). I used Chun-Li and Wolverine. By the way, Wolverine is pretty good against normal War Machine, since his Fatal Claw goes through his knee dive....oh darn, half of WM's strategy is gone.    Hardly ever, if you're playing Rob.   Shyeah right! If there's anything I've learned, it's that nobody really manhandles anybody if you know what you're doing. If you don't believe me, go around the country and play all the competition. I guarantee you you'll find people who can take some of the worst characters (like Morrigan and Gambit) and whup Chun-Li's ass. This is why this game has amazing longevity....how long has it been out now, two years? Even longer I think. But people still play it because the game is so deep that you just keep coming back for more. In fact I fear the release of Capcom's next versus game....if SNK versus Capcom is anything like the previous VS series, I can guarantee that it won't be as good as MvsC, but you know that everybody's going to play it anyway.

{"text": "<YCR>: Hmmm.....I'm not sure why, because it does work. The only problem is you need perfect timing (as in, wait 2-3 seconds, so the missiles are overhead, then do the Captain Sword). If you mistime.....well, kiss Cap goodbye. And the only other problem is that both War Machines have to be on the same side of you. But this strategy is useless against skilled War Machine players, who either cross up with the duo, or attempt to sweep you and juggle with the War Destroyer (which puts them way too close for you to safely do the Captain Sword).", "metadata": {"source": "SF2 Google group", "author": "WhoaMoses, Darksyde"}}

{"text": "<YCR>: There was a big Marvel vs. Capcom tourney in CT today, and here's just a few of the things that I saw that really impressed me:  Red/White Venom actually does have two real infinites. The first of which you guys probably have already seen: just knock them up with fierce punch near the corner, do the normal air combo, but do it REALLY slowly (for white venom anyways) so that the last hit of the jumping roundhouse connects just before they hit the ground. Then when they land, OTG them with a standing short, then do repeated crouching strong->crouching FP, crouching strong->crouching FP, etc......ouch, it's pretty easy from there on in. But then I saw something I couldn't believe: the simplest infinite ever. Just do a normal jump forward and catch them in the air (they have to be jumping too) with a forward->roundhouse chain. Land, jump back up, juggle with another forward->roundhouse while they're still in the air (the first time is the only tricky part), land, jump again, etc. It's ridiculously easy and ridiculously cheesy. I couldn't believe my eyes, and neither could anyone else. As if these two tactics weren't enough, Red/White Venom is a ground monster too. That ducking FP is sick man! I've heard that SpiderDan is king of R/WV, I hope I can see him play one day.  Overall, the tourney was pretty much a success. We had 43 entrees, although about 3 didn't show. In the end, it came down to me (Phil Burnell, don't know if anybody's heard of me besides Viscant) and Rob Aponte, who got 2nd at ECC4. Well let me just put it this way: after the results of the last tourney (Rob beat me, sent me to the loser's bracket, I fought my way back up to him and beat him once, but then he barely won the final match, I was stuck with 2nd and disgruntled) I was pretty determined to do my best. Well it finally came down to me and Rob again...only this time I beat his double War Machines with Wolverine/Ryu. Let me tell ya, Wolverine is the GWM killer! Jumping FP->RH, drill claw away. He can't do anything to retaliate, and you can do it all over again. If he tries the knee drop->FP->standing forward->shoulder cannon (missle), just push block and throw. He was mad, you could tell. Ryu isn't too shabby either: walk underneath GWM's knee drop and throw, then call out Colossus while he's getting up (he's stuck in hitstun) and shinkuu-hadoken. And if he goes for the aerial smart bomb, jump up to him and shinkuu-hadoken right through it. I didn't even try to stop his dual attack because I didn't want to risk it, so I just blocked and took all that damage from about 10 War Destroyers. Well anyways I beat Rob and sent him to the losers bracket....and no surprise he fought his way to the top and defeated Brian Jin (I think that's how you spell it) although his White Venom almost killed him, until a massive comeback. By the way, I hear that Brian got all his White Venom skills from watching SpiderDan in action...anyways! It came down to me (I was undefeated) and Rob again. It was kind of ironic, because last tournament HE had been undefeated, and I had fought my way to the top of the loser's bracket to fight him again. Well to make a long story short (too late!) I used the same tactics and beat him. So I was undefeated for the whole tournament, and received $75 in tokens. I was SUPPOSED to get a tape of the tourney, but of course they didn't record it....arg, cheap bastards. Actually, Rob could have beaten me if he had used Strider or Zangief in place of GWM, simply because I can trash him now. I'm surprised he didn't try it out. Oh well, until the next tourney.....  WhoaMoses, KING of all things Video My favorite quote came from Rob: \"I knew that if somebody would beat me, it would be you....because of those bitchy throwing tactics.\" My reply: \"Victory, by any means necessary....\"", "metadata": {"source": "SF2 Google group", "author": "WhoaMoses, Darksyde"}}

{"text": "<YCR>: *sigh* Now i hafta retype all of this:  Okay, the two Red/White Venom infinites are:  1.) Knock them up with a standing fierce punch near the corner (very important, they MUST be in the corner for this to work). Jump after them, do the basic air combo chain (jab, short, strong, forward, fierce, roundhouse), but SLOWLY (for Red Venom anyway) so that the last hit of the roundhouse connects just as they're about to land. If done correctly, you should land just as they do. Now, do a standing short to OTG them, then a crouching strong->fierce punch, crouching strong->fierce punch, etc.  2.) As the opponent is jumping towards you, jump forward and do a quick forward->roundhouse chain in the air. You will land before them, so jump forward again and repeat. If timed correctly (basically just keep holding up-forward on the joystick and pressing forward->roundhouse when you reach them) it is a ridiculously easy, ridiculously cheesy infinite combo which blew my socks off.....luckily nobody figured it out until AFTER the tournament was over.", "metadata": {"source": "SF2 Google group", "author": "WhoaMoses, Darksyde"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: I can already tell there are...  from the fierce to hit them off the ground (it looks like he should though).  Hmm...well, to be honest the whole thing is pretty damned fast....and I believe now that you reminded me that I've seen it done both with fierce punch and roundhouse. But fierce punch is easier, it's what everybody was using.   This must be a new addition (or correction) to the Dreamcast version. In the arcade, Red/White Venom is not pushed back at all after using the crouching fierce punch, which is why this infinite works. It's like he crouches and sticks to the ground and just keeps going and going and going...    I dunno, maybe this was fixed too? All I know is it was definitely forward->roundhouse. First all those sharp edges came out of Venom, then he turned liquidy and did that multi-hit air bite thing where the snakes swirl around him. So I'm sure it was those buttons.   No offense taken. Hey, I haven't even tried to do the infinites myself, I'm just relating what I saw at the tournament. If you say it doesn't work in the Dreamcast version, it probably doesn't. Most likely, Capcom fixed the infinites to make the game more balanced. I wonder if Gambit's infinite is still in there?

{"text": "<YCR>: What's really funny here, is that a few months ago I was the only guy on this MB who disliked A3. While everybody else was saying it was better than ST and the best street fighter ever....i was arguing how hella boring the game was. It's slow, and most of the characters STILL suck (instead of tweaking the characters, it seemed like only a select few were left the same and everybody else was weakened, therefore making the untouched characters \"better\" than all the others). I said that overall MvC was a better game, not because it has better play mechanics or better characters or combos....but because overall it's just a hell of a lot more fun to play. But everybody flamed me (what's funny is that all the people who flamed me, no longer post on this board, so what happened to them?). Of course I knew this would happen....when a game is relatively new, everybody is so high on the hype that even if the game sucked huge ass they'd swear it was the best thing they'd ever seen. Hell, the same thing happened with Zelda 64, until everybody realized it was just 60 hours of the same repetitive dungeon-exploring bull$hit.   If you play the game at home by yourself, and so the abusable nuances don't affect you, then more power to ya. But the fact remains that the game is just shit at a highly competitive level. Oh, yeah, by the way, if you think A3 is better than KOF98....get the Dreamcast versions of both games. I'd go with KOF98 any friggin day, with better music, more frames of animation (and much better art), more characters, etc. So what if there are only 2 modes of play instead of three?

{"text": "<YCR>: Okay, so I'm not Spider-Dan. But I am friends with Rob Aponte, the guy who got 2nd at ECC4 with his double War Machines. And since I play him just about every day, I guess I know a little bit about your questions.   As far as I can tell, no. Rob never does it from a normal jump.   It depends on what you want to do to them, and how close they are. If they are still pretty far away, use standing forward and chain into a shoulder missle (fireball + kick). But if they're right next to ya (i.e., after a Berserker Barrage X) use standing roundhouse and air combo. Rob uses this air combo all the time that goes something like SJ jab, short, strong, shoulder missle.   Basically, GWM should be in the air at all times. So as soon as the round starts, you have a lot of options. You can SJ, and then either throw a smart bomb (by the way, don't ever use the shoulder missle in the air unless in a combo, it leaves him WAAAY too open for moves like the Shinkuu-Hadoken) or use a knee drop, or both. You'll find that the knee drop, if timed correctly, will negate most helpers and special moves, even supers. And if it doesn't, you can actually cancel into another smart bomb. Example: You're knee dropping, when all of a sudden Chun-Li desides to use a surprise Kikosho. Don't fret: as soon as the Kikosho starts to hit, cancel into a smart bomb. GWM actually bounces off the energy ball with his knees, and moves UP a few pixels for some reason. Now you're perfectly safe.   As far as I can tell, it doesn't really matter. Rob thinks he's so good, he always uses random helpers. You're right tho, Lou is kinda useless since GWM can't cross-up. Use the basics like Colussus and Psylocke, and combo into Proton Cannon.   You should ALWAYS be taking advantage that GWM can get hit and still do moves. The best time to activate the duo seems to be after somebody lands a super on you, or when they're attacking while airborne.   Hmm.....I don't quite understand you here. I know that if you immediately do a War Destroyer motion after the duo is activated, both WMs will generally start the move at the same time. So when they finish, they will be wide open for a few seconds. The best thing to do is to get GWM next to your opponent, because if they try to hit him at any time, they eat missles since he doesn't stun. To mix up the double team a little, use a crouching forward to knock them down, then OTG with double War Destroyer. Usually, the only way you can get double WMs NOT to do the War Destroyers at the same exact time (so basically there's no \"lag time\" between their supers and you're totally safe) is when one of them is getting attacked, and so can't do their super. But I'm not the expert on that, so don't quote me or anything.   Well, basically the sword super only takes damage if you're standing on the ground. If in the air, it only takes a pixel or two. So just SJ immediately as the round starts, or jump forward and use down+fierce, or jump backward, whatever. Just as long and you're not on the ground when the sword touches you, you won't take any sufficient damage. I'm sure that the shoulder missle can knock Cap out of the sword if timed correctly, but it's better to jump and not risk mistiming it and eating 50% damage.   It was probably Eddie, since I've never seen anything like that before. Sounds like something Rob would get really pissed about, it's so simple. I would assume it's a pretty good strategy, except that it leaves GWM wide open for helpers like Colossus.

You see, if you don't initially connect the Shin-Shoryuken and get the 4-hit big damage auto-combo, it turns into a juggle move of sorts. Once I was Ryu, and my opponent was Wolverine. I had only a sliver of energy left, he had about one-third of his. Well, he decided to use a well timed Fatal Claw right after I did a whiffed crouching roundhouse. I decided to try something stupid to save my life....so I did a Shin-Shoryuken. Ryu became invincible, flew up with the uppercut, and tagged Wolvie in midair, out of the Fatal Claw. I immediately began mashing the buttons, and amazingly the move which I thought for certain would whiff turned into a massive 9 hit juggle combo that just barely KILLED Wolverine!

{"text": "<YCR>: It's pretty simple actually. It's something Capcom has been doing for years. Don't let them fool you; they probably have third strike completed for DC already. However... Think of it this way. If you release third strike and SF3 Double impact at the same time, who would buy double impact? Nobody, since the newer game is also out there. So....what Capcom will do, is release Double impact just in time for the holiday season (it makes the perfect Christmas gift! seems like a decent ad campaign, no?). Then, one month later, they'll release third strike, so all those kiddies who saved up their christmas money can get it. So, by doing this, they sell two games instead of one, and a hell of a lot of them to boot due to the holidays. Get it?  <<On a different note, anyone bought KOF99 for Dreamcast? I like the game but I hate how they made it seem like it was gonna be different from KOF98 'cause it's almost exactly the same damn thing!>>  It IS the same damn thing dude. The only real difference is that the music is remixed, the graphics are cleaner, and the backrounds are 3D (they kick ass!). But other than that (and the fact that you can play as Omega Rugal) the game is exactly the same.

{"text": "<YCR>: I think that speed is an important factor in the enjoyment level of any game. Generally, the more fast-paced a game, the more fun it is. Of course, there are exceptions (anybody remember the old SNES version of SF2T, with the 10-star speed setting? It was a trip!) But the tendency is that as games progress, they get faster...SF2, SF2CE, SF2Turbo, SSF2 (an exception, which generally got bad ratings because it was too slow), SSFT2, then the Alpha series which generally kept the same speed throughout, then SF3 which was rated slow and therefore inferior, and the versus series which is faster than the rest. Faster games are more fun to play because you have to be REALLY good to react in time, so if you can amass a good number of wins then you know that you must have some skills to speak of.

{"text": "<YCR>: Strider does NOT need to be toned down... the other characters just need a second less or   My goodness...if you don't agree that Strider needs to be toned down, you must either be a biased Strider player, or you just haven't played  any good Striders. I live in CT, and if anybody remembers ECC4, they'll remember how CT represented in the MvsC tourney. There are some really good Strider players here, who make life hard for anybody else (even Wolverine!) How, you ask??? Well.. 1.) Strider has INSANE priority over most other characters' normal attacks. His standing forward is just ridiculous....try to do a dashing- in combo with Wolvie, go ahead, against a Strider standing forward, and just see what happens....a 4-hit 40% combo, that's what! And his jumping forward is sick too....Strider can basically stay in the air all day if he wants, just jumping and using well-timed normal attacks because of that damned sword.   2.) The Oroborous. Let's face it: any super that attempts to give you an infinite-combo ability for a limited time is just lame anyway. When I first saw this super 2 years ago, I thought it would be either devastatingly cheesy, or worthless...well, to most people it is pretty worthless. But to a skilled CT player, it is simply step 2 in Strider's cheese ability. No Jinston, you are NOT the MvsC god that you seem to think you are, the Oroborous is not so easy to get out of. Just push block, and super jump??? What planet are you on fool? Any good Strider player taps a button, then dashes forward to start you blocking...if you super jump right away, he jumps a little and does the QCF+Punch teleport-type move to get a ring to touch you on the way down. Either  way you end up blocking....now try to push-block, go ahead. If you're playing a good Strider player, he's already done 2 of the 4-hit ground combos and charged another super meter. And sometimes they teleport right behind you, forcing you to block with no escape...and no, you CAN'T super jump after a push block because the rings still keep you blocking, idiot. Your haughty, know-it-all attitude is not appreciated, especially when you're WRONG.   3.) As if these weren't enough, you can use Psylock to do a 100% combo: Psylocke, Legion, Psylocke, another Legion, Psylocke, Legion...and you can stick an Oroborous, teleport behind anywhere in there too. So have fun.  If Strider isn't toned down, the game will suck. Nuff' said.", "metadata": {"source": "SF2 Google group", "author": "WhoaMoses, Darksyde"}}

{"text": "<YCR>: Hmm, I never thought that posting my personal experience with throws would create such an uproar. After reading all of these posts, it seems to me that throwing is generally accepted and used by most people, and that only scrubs bitch about it (notice I said GENERALLY not ALWAYS. I remember the original SF2 ticks which drove me batty, and I bitched many a time...) What's funny is that people talk about playing the game with \"honor\", and that's why they don't throw....but if you do it to them, they shoot you! What honor! I'm so sick of this world, where these pussies can simply buy a gun and they think they're \"the shit.\" I see it every day in my town, these little fucking wimps who like to call themselves \"thugs\" and pretend that they're \"tough mofos.\" Well if I ever get into a fight with one of them, hand-to-hand, I guarantee you I'LL be the one standing afterwards. And if they pull a gun on me? I hope they have pretty good aim, because if they don't hit me with the first shot, I'll have already punctured their windpipe and ended their life...  Am I afraid to throw in fighting games? No. I've done it since the very first day that SF2 was released in arcades (which I can still remember clearly) and I'll continue to do it for the rest of my life. I will not let ANYONE intimidate me. Believe me many have tried, and failed. In the end they either just complained a whole lot, out loud, or tried to insult me by calling me a no-skill scrub. Usually I just let it go...on occasion I can't control myself and I say something back, but so far that's as far as it's gone. Nobody has tried to attack me or shoot me because of it (although a lot of people have talked shit but never came through with it), and hopefully nobody ever will. After all, it IS only a game, and it's not worth getting killed over, right? There are only two reasons that you can possibly lose: 1.) Outside factors, like somebody is bugging you while you're playing, or the controls are broken, etc. or 2.) Your skills were inferior to the other player's. They used infinites, throws, over-powered characters, combos, strategies, whatever, to beat you, and you lost. Now GET OVER IT and either don't play anymore if it makes you upset, or renew your conviction and try again. You can't get better if you don't lose and learn from the losses.  Now if you lose because of #1, I can see why you'd be mad. You are then justified to beat the fuck out of whoever was distracting and bothering you, or you can give shit to the owner of the arcade for having a broken game. But if the reason is #2, and you lose, and you bitch to the other player about it, FUCK YOU. You are a loser. I bitch a lot, but when I do, I NEVER blame it on the other player being cheesy...I try to blame it on the controls or something. I know that deep down it was my fault that I lost, but I'm not about to yell at the top of my lungs I'M A FUCKING LOSER! But I never accuse the other player of being cheap...I accept everything, from infinites to throws to even ridiculous Strider and Ibuki over-priority (I had to accept it, I was one of Tee Carter's best friends and he always had a knack for finding out who the over-powered character was in the 1st week a game was out...and then he'd never use anyone else. Arg.) I remember, Tee would complain too about my throwing, but he never fought me about it or anything. If he got mad, he'd just stop playing for a while and cool down, and come back when he wasn't mad anymore. He admitted that throws were NOT cheating, or cheap, but just another part of the game that needed to be overcome to win. Tee was a very smart kid, for the place where he came from (very bad area) and how underpriviledged he was. What happened to him? He was killed by a thug, for no reason. The guy didn't even know him...  I think that the problem with throwing is 2 things: 1.) Normal people get annoyed by it. They bitch about it (which is perfectly ok). Some people can handle it, learn from it, and use it to their advantage. Others can accept it and choose not to use it. Then there are those who just can't accept it, because they simply aren't smart enough to learn how to counter it, and so to cover up their inadequacies they say \"you're a scrub,\" or \"you fight without honor, because you have to throw to win.\" Whatever. If you think it's dishonorable to throw in a fighting game, you need to look up what the defenition of honor really means. Now get the fuck out of my arcade you loser. YOU are problem #1. 2.) Problem #2 is thugs, who think they rule the world and are the shit. If anybody beats them, they go nuts and start shooting people. About that shooting in Atlanta...I bet you that even if the person hadn't thrown, they still would have been shot. The shooter obviously was a self-conscious little fuck who felt like an ass for being beat, got really mad, and didn't know how to deal with his anger, so he shot the guy. Oh boy, what a man he was. Truly full of \"honor.\"   In conclusion, I think that we gamers have to take a stand against this general \"bitchiness\" that has seeped into our arcades. The next time somebody complains about you throwing, tell him \"Look, either play me again and learn how to get around it, or just don't play me anymore. Either way, stop bitching, because only pathetic people bitch. Just learn from your mistakes, and beat me!\" And if you're afraid of getting shot? Don't go to that arcade anymore. Let the idiots shoot themselves and kill themselves off. Believe me guys, it won't last much longer anyways.

{"text": "<YCR>: Here's my log from today's huge CT MvsC2 tournament:  Let me give my account of the August 3rd tournament at FYE, which I just got home from. I think this was probably the most exciting and eventful tournament there has been at FYE in a long time.  First of all, this being Bobby's last tournament (he was the manager of the arcade for a while), he decided to make it a lot more professional than the last few. Even thought it started late, as usual, he brought back the tables and the barriers to make more room for the players, and he made a real effort to make this the fairest and most fun tournament in a while. There were over TWICE the amount of players from the last tournament, I think the final count was something like 32. Bobby decided to do his usual \"weird\" thing; this time it wasn't setting the game on low damage, but making ALL THE FIRST ROUND MATCHES best 2 out of 3, and having all the other matches single fights. Bad idea, because now you've got 16 matches that ALL extended into three rounds each....that's a whopping 48 matches in the first round alone. Surprisingly in an upset, I lost my first round matches, in which I used either Doom/Cable/Blackheart or Cyclops/Cable/Blackheart, to Waterbury's Richie (Doom/Cable/Cyclops). For some reason I was having a hard time with him, probably because his Cable was more than decent and I'm not used to that. Anyways I should have won the first match, but instead of just blocking Doom's blue energy ball super, I called a helper on reaction by accident and ended up losing by mere pixels because of a time out. So the second match began...and I destroyed him, still having nearly full health bars for both Cable and Blackheart. I don't remember much about the third match, except that I got my ass beat pretty bad. Wow, did that get my spirits down. I honestly have no excuse besides I smoke too much dope. Well, anyways, the rest of the first round finished much as predicted, with the regulars winning over the not-so-regulars.  One thing that was very unfortunate, however, was the woman who just out of the blue started having seizures in the middle of the arcade. If anybody has ever seen someone having a seizure, they know how horrible it looks, and the thing is, there's really nothing you can do unless you're a trained doctor and know what's going on. The woman is retarded, I always see her and her husband in the mall almost every day for the past two years, and nothing like this has ever happened before. I really feel bad, and sad that some people have to go through things like that. It makes you look on your own life and you realize just how much you really have, and how good you have it, compared to other people.  Anyways, continuing with my tournament log. After my first loss, I felt pretty stupid and embarrassed, so I felt like doing something to feel better. I was pretty hungry, all I'd had to eat all day was a yogurt and two slices of french toast, so I decided to get something for everybody to eat. Money is no big deal to me, so I went to Dunkin' Donuts and bought three dozen assorted donuts and 50 munchkins for everybody to enjoy. It cost me $21.59, what a jerk, he wouldn't give me a mall discount even though I've worked in the mall for over 2 years. For the most part it was a success, everybody seemed really happy, but there were about 25 munchkins and 12 donuts left after everything was done. I was feeling pretty mad that nobody would eat my donuts, then somebody from FYE ran in and stole them...so at least they went to good use. Good stuff. I think a lot more people like me now, heh.  Anyways, now with the actual tournament results. My next match was against Matt (GohanFan's little brother) and I was really hungry, so I ate a donut and drank a soda while fighting him. I know it seemed really insulting, but I was really hungry and I mean everybody knew I was going to win anyway, so I just had to. I beat him fairly easily and moved on.  My next match was against black Rich, who I heard had just won a New Britain tournament and a few others. I was a little intimidated when we started to fight, but apparently he was more so: he seemed more worried about the match than I was. Rightly so I guess, because his Magneto/IronMan/? couldn't stand up to the cheap chipping patterns and instant Air Hyper Viper Beams of my feared Doom/Cable/Blackheart team.  Now here's where the big problem was: Ryan showed up over an hour late for the tournament, and Bobby still let him enter! And he was equal with ME for some reason, getting a bye! AND he was my next match! Everybody knows that Ryan and I have a rivalry going and that we go back and forth between who's the best, so I knew it would be a tough match. It was his Strider/Doom/Blackheart versus my Doom/Cable/Blackheart. I wondered why he literally RAN to the lefthand side of the machine before our match started.....and I found out why while I was playing. I could NOT do ONE photon charge in the air with Doom no matter how I tried, I think the stick was just too loose or something at that time. I know the stick worked fine later on in the night...but it just didn't feel right during that match. I don't know how else to explain it, maybe my hand just didn't feel like working, but every time I tried to do the Blackheart assist/Doom photon charge trap, Doom would do a jab instead of the lazers and I would end up having to block a Strider/Doom chipping rush. So I realized my Doom was useless and tagged in Cable....big mistake, I forgot that Cable dies to Strider/Doom chipping trap fairly easily, and that the Blackheart assist/jump back viper beam trap wouldn't work because he had Blackheart too and he was getting his helper off before mine. So finally I got Blackheart in there, and did my thing. It ended up that I wittled him down to just Strider and Doom, against my Blackheart and Doom. In the LAST seconds of the match, he managed to do a Photon Array for LOTS of chip, then switch to Strider and run away for about 2 seconds, for the win. A win by about ONE pixel of energy with a time out. Obviously I was pissed: I know I can beat Ryan, I do it all the time, if my Photon Charges had come out I would have definitely gotten my trap patterns down and won the match. And he shouldn't have been allowed to play anyway! After the match Ryan tried to talk shit, but I just pointed at the energy bars and said \"pixels my friend. you won by PIXELS. I hope you feel lucky.\"  At this point I was feeling like an idiot and I re-entered by paying Bobby $3. Sux, but I had to do it. I know my first loss was bullshit, and my second loss was even worse. I was put in a match against Web, who in my opinion is underrated, because he's very good, a great thinker, who can adapt to situations quicker than a lot of other player's I've faced. He figured out how to get out of my Doom/BH trap pretty well, then he somehow managed to kill Cable off fairly easily. I barely was able to beat him with Blackheart...definitely a close match and one of my favorites of the night. Many props to Web.  At this point there was some controversy: the mall was going to close very soon, as in less than an hour, and we still had over 20 matches left. Everybody was wondering if we would be allowed to finish the tournament....but everything ended up fine. Why? Because Bobby called about three names, and the people weren't there, so they were eliminated. And guess what? One of them was RYAN of all people. He showed up like 30 seconds late and was really pissed. I'm sure I would be too, but first of all don't show up 2 hours late for the tournament, and second of all BE THERE FOR YOUR TURN especially when you're extremely pressed for time. So I guess I lucked out with Ryan's getting eliminated for free....I honestly wanted to play him again and prove that I can beat him, because I KNOW I can, I've done it lots of times before....but it didn't happen. Kind of dick on Bobby's part but it had to be done to save time.  At this point, it was already 9:30, and the arcade was supposed to be closed, but since this was Bobby's last tournament (he has a better job now) it was allowed to finish. But everyone who wasn't playing, or who got beaten, was made to leave. So about 14 people got kicked out leaving about 10 players in the arcade.  My next few matches were against Jose and Germaine, I don't remember much besides me winning pretty straightforward. It's kind of hard to use rushing characters against teams like mine, who just stay away all day and throw shit all over the screen, never putting their physical bodies in danger.  My next match, for 4th place, was against Shoubert. We really haven't played each other for a long time, Shu is always at work at Pretzel Time and so he really doesn't get much practice in....but let me tell you, he surprised the HELL out of me. He nearly beat me, taking me by surprise and really preventing me from using any of my trap patterns very effectively. Neither of us could really catch the other one with ANYTHING, not supers or combos or much of anything except a roundhouse kick here or a random super there. We both had SO much life left when time ran out...but it ended up that I had a little more, so I won. Once again, MANY props to Shu for surprising me and staying good at the game even when he doesn't get to play it much.  Next was for third place, and of all the people, I had to fight RICHIE, the guy who had managed to beat me in the first round. Our rematch was on. But I had him this time: I stopped fucking around, I ignored the cheers and jeers of all the other Waterbury players, and I managed to beat him convincingly. Good match tho, once again I was really surprised, he wasn't that good at MvsC1, but he's definitely the best in Waterbury at part 2 right now.  And so it came down to just me and Bobby, just like last time. Considering that he learned how to play with Blackheart and Cable by watching me, I knew I had a distinct advantage over him, but then he picked Iron Man, and Bobby's Iron Man is more than decent. But I shut him down: both his Iron Man and Blackheart could do nothing against my Blackheart assist but eat ice columns all day long. I did have a little bit of trouble with his Cable though, mainly due to his Blackheart assist that made it hard for me to do anything, but in the end I was triumphant again.  So that was it. It was now 10:10 and everything was closed in the mall except for the arcade, which was pitch black. Everybody left and I got my tokens and left. I was so tired, playing games from 5 to 10, and having to fight my way through the entire losers' and winners' brackets AGAIN for the comeback victory.  In conclusion, I have to mention and respect the skills of a lot of players who I faced today, specifically Web, Richie, Shoubert, Bobby, and Rich. You guys are really good, keep up the practicing and you'll get better. Seeing what I saw today, I believe that CT is very close to being able to compete with the rest of the country in MvsC2. Maybe I can get some people to come with me to the August 27th tournament at Chinatown Fair in NYC to help represent CT. And to Ryan: You may have won the single battle, but not the war. Your foolishness got you eliminated from the tournament, which sucked, because I wanted to face you again and prove that your narrow victory was just a fluke. Damned missed photon charges. Anyways, I will challenge you ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, remember that, and I'll once again prove that I'm more than able to beat you.  In closing, I did just what I said I would do: I won the tournament, and although it wasn't total domination, I am a human being who makes mistakes....and it was those stupid mistakes that almost cost me my victory. I need to practice more of my patterns and traps to become good enough to represent CT next month at Chinatown, and in September at the nationals in Chicago. But my ability to come back, fight my way through the losers' bracket, and take the win even despite my losses, proves that I am, right now, the best in CT, and the best candidate to represent us in big tournaments. Nuff' said.   The final rankings: 1. Phil a.k.a. Darksyde (Doom/Cable/Blackheart) 2. Bobby a.k.a. Mr. FYE (Iron Man/Cable/Blackheart) 3. Richie a.k.a. Mr. Waterbury (Cyclops/Cable/Doom) 4.

{"text": "<YCR>: Just reposting this, because a lot of people said it didn't show up on their NG readers...  Today there was a tournament in Meriden....a full state tournament for MvsC2 in Connecticut....this is my log of my personal experiences during the tournament.  The tournament was a surprising success. Even though it was delayed a week (because a button broke last week and the arcade employees were unable to fix it), I think it was honestly the best MvsC2 tournament that has been held in CT. I think just about EVERBODY was there....around 40 people...with the exception of maybe Bobby, Shoubert, Rob Aponte, and Dru....but without a doubt there were people there to take their place anyway. Due to LOTS of traffic delays (the Merritt Parkway was backed up for about a half hour), the tournament started an hour late. The matches were different from last week: to save time, all matches up to the semi-finals would be single fights, while the semis would be best 2 out of 3. Well the tournament started out typically, with regulars like P.J. (Essex on IRC) (Spiral/Magneto/?), me (Darksyde) (Doom/Cyke/Cable), Ryan Lee (Strider/Cyclops/Doom), Brian Jin (Strider/Doom/Cable), Rich Williams (Cable/Magneto/Iron Man), Richie from Waterbury (Cable/Cyke/Tron), a kid named Andrew from Meriden (Magneto/Iron Man/?), and others winning their first round matches without much of a hitch, quickly weeding out most of the scrubs. But to a lot of people's surpirse, some of the more favored players actually LOST their first round matches...Kev (Cammy/Storm/Commando) and others. Why? Well let me explain something about the controllers at Meriden Arcade (Jester's Courtyard). They're DIAGONAL FROM THE SCREEN. That's right, they are diagonal, forcing you to look at the game from an awkward angle. Let me explain in more detail:  The face of the controls on a normal cabinet is set up like this:  l joy1 buttons joy2 buttons l l________________________________l  coinslot coinslot  But at Meriden arcade, it's set up like this: \\ / \\ joy1(angled) buttons(angled)/ \\ buttons(ang.) joy2(angled) / \\___________________________/ coinslot coinslot  So basically, you're forced to stand diagonally to play the game. Why is this bad? Because most players, by reflex, try to correct their stance to face the game straight during a heated match.....forcing them to hold the joystick wrong....and miss simple moves like AHVB or just blocking low. A LOT of people were complaining about this, and it was very evident that during about 90% of the matches, at some point someone would miss something that should have connected, simply because they were not used to the controls. I thought the loose stickes at ECC2000 were ghey, until I went to Meriden and saw the Clown Machine.  Anyways.... Trying to remember some of the better matches and strategies... It seemed like in general people wanted to take a break from Blackheart, I was the only person in the entire tournament to use him. Most of the winning teams instead consisted of Doom/Cable/Cyke/Strider combinations. There really wasn't much new to see, besides that Cable is still a royal pain in the ass, and that besides Cable and Commando, Doom really doesn't have any bad matches to speak of. Some notable moments: I think it was P.J. against Ty Pathammavong (who is, by the way, the ONLY person ranked in CT on the CTF website for the MvsC2 100 hits tourney this Sunday....and he told me he isn't even going, wtf) in the semi-finals of the losers bracket......it came down to something like P.J.'s Cable/? vs. Ty's Cable/Iceman or something like that. It was probably the worst match I've ever seen....BOTH players who are usually on the ball, missed about 10 AHVB each instead getting just FPs or stupid-looking rising FP viper beams......the match ended with P.J. doing a standing short->RH chain into HVB, and for some reason that I still can't understand, the HVB didn't connect but was able to be blocked....Ty countered with his own HVB and it was peace out for Essex. Another spectacular match was Ryan Lee (Strider/Doom/StormCammyCable?) vs. Brian Jin (Doom/Cable/Cyke?). Well in short it was a pretty typical match, with the Strider/Doom trap in effect until Jin's Cyke Anti-air assist stopping it and leading into AHVB combos....a LOT of DHCing left both fighters with only Doom remaining, with about 75% life. Truly a mirror match for the ages, both immediately SJed and tried photons....which canceled each other out perfectly...so both went for a photon array, which cancelled each other out perfectly.....and the fight continued on the ground. Lots of blocked ground chains. Eventually Jin got Ryan's Doom into an air combo finishing with a photon array, but Ryan SJed again.....Jin tried to photon charge him on the way up but missed...and Ryan basically did a photon array directly into Doom's face. Ouch. Peace out, by pixels, an excellent match.  At some point during the night, I fought Ty Pathammavong, and I really can't remember much besides that I dominated him. Don't ask me why Cen ranked him and not me, I mean I respect his skills and all but there's just no reason why he should be ranked while I'm just ignored. Maybe because I was giving Cen shit the other night about banning the winner of a match from switching their character order at the CTF tourney on Sunday. Whatever.  Anyways, I had to fight Richie from Waterbury (Cable/Cyke/Tron) to fight for who would be the top contender, and who would fight the winner of the losers' bracket for 2nd place. Richie is good, no doubt, and I respect his skills: the first match was typical: he rarely misses an AHVB, he uses Cyke anti-air assist very well to break traps, and to my surprise his Cable OWNS my Doom. Whenever I tried to superjump and throw photons...he would be there with me about 90% of the time, viper beaming or AHVBing me out of them. Its friggin annoying. I wasn't planning on using Blackheart at all, so for the second match I was forced to try to use my Cable to beat his...which usually is no problem with my team of Cable/Doom/Cyke. But then he pulled out the secret weapon for Cable vs. Cable mirror matches: the Tron projectile assist. I knew that for some reason the assist did ridiculous damage, but I had no clue how good it was as an assist for Cable. You see, usually since you can't do anything to Cable when the match starts because they both have meter, it becomes jumping RH, assist matchup, until someone messes up and gets cought with a AHVB. His damned Tron would come out and make me block, and during that time he would jump over and cross me up with a RH, then combo into a standing short->RH->HVB combo. Ouchie. So the next time I tried to call out Cyke to stop Tron...he ate about 30% damage from Tron, in addition to a AHVB from Cable. I couldn't counter (you CAN'T counter AHVBs) so basically he got the damage for free. It seemed like no matter what I did he couldn't be stopped.....either Tron/Cable chipped, or connected for big damage, or my assist hit but paid the price. The match was over, I'd lost.  So I had to fight Ryan Lee, of all people, for 2nd place. We have a long-standing rivalry of who is the best in our area, and lately is has been undoubtedly me, with my Doom owning him about 90% of the time. But Ryan had been watching Richie fight me, so I figured it would be unsafe to pick Doom and have him copy what Richie was doing with Cable....so I took Blackheart out of retirement and used Cyke/Cable/BH against his Strider/Storm/Doom. Decent match, but I owned since about 90% of the time I can shut down his Srider with a ducking FP over and over and over....then if he teleports, jump back RH with Cable Anti-air assist....Strider basically got shut down and died. Storm came out, ate a lot of Cyke AAA->AHVB combos and died. Doom just gave up, heh. The second match was a lot better, with Ryan's classic \"rushdown\" team of Strider/Cammy/Storm if I'm not mistaken. He beat me that one, mainly because I had a brain fart and missed about 4 AHVBs, coming out with dumb jumping attacks instead. The final match was also very intense....basically a mirror match of the last one, I wasn't willing to give up so easily. This time his Strider did a little more damage to me....but I still shut him down. His Cammy was doing a good number on my Cyke somehow, so I got Cable in there...which is usually a good move, except that I forgot that Storm's projectile assist combined with Cammy's jumping cannon drill is nearly unstoppable...and that Hail Storm PUNISHES whiffed helpers...since Cyke was already low on health there was little I could do........ eventually I called out Cyke by accident and he died to a hail Storm, bleeh. So it was my Cable and BH (both about 50%) against his Cammy and Storm. Cammy's Anti-air assist caught Cable and AGAIN Ryan comboed into hailstorm....cable had about a pixel of energy left...so by total luck, I landed a standing FP and comboed into a BH swtich. I was almost shutting down Storm, but she was tagging me a few times pretty good....a lot of times I did Infernos and tried to cancel into Heart of Darkness, but instead I got nothing (cuz of the fuqued diagonal controls) and ended up eating the lighting attack-> electric storm combo. finally Ryan caught my BH with and air combo, did a lighting attack in the combo, and tried to do an electric storm....but then HE messed up because of the controls and the super came out late....BH landed, did an Inferno, and this time the HOD cancel worked....PEACE OUT STORM by pixels. Cammy came out with only a little chunk of health and quickly lost to BH/Cable. It was one of the best matches I've ever been in, with Ryan leading, me coming back, then Ryan coming back and almost winning (if he had gotten that Storm air combo off it was over for me, it was just pure luck that he messed up) and then me taking advantage of his mistake and taking the win. MUCH respect for Ryan.  So again, it was me vs Richie for 1st place. At this point, the arcade was sweltering because it has NO A/C ARG and I was tired out from playing the grueling match against Ryan. Richie was all fresh and cheery, and gave me a big smile. ARG. I drank about half of Speedy's soda and slowly picked Cable/Cyke/BH to counter Richie's Cable/Cyke/Tron. At first it was working, my jump back viperbeam + inferno assist chip trap working, but then I tried to rush him again...and started eating Tron assists...and ending up with only BH/Cyke. BH made a TREMENDOUS comeback, defeating his Cyke and wittling his Cable down to a sliver of energy....then his Cable AHVBed him out of existense....then my Cyke with about 10% energy left jumped onto the scene and defeated Cable with a single jumping RH. Finally, it was Tron vs. Cyke, but his Tron still had about 40% life left to my 10%. I caught him with about 2 blocked jump-back SOBs and made the energy even....and then ate a standing jab->forward->lunch rush combo, losing the match. HOW HUMILIATING.  Well it was the second match, and it would be the last one if I didn't win....being stupid me, I totally forgot about the Doom/BH trap for some reason and again went with Cable/Cyke/BH (I'm stubborn like that)......and got owned. I tried to make my comeback with BH again, but every time I tried to cancel an inferno into a HOD, BH would just stand there stupidly and gaze back at me like I was retarded. Bastard. He ate about 3 AHVBs and I was basically peaced out.  In short, I learned a lot of things today: -Even if you are a better player, one assist or trap or strategy that you don't know how to counter can shut you down. And if you're not used to the controls, you're going to make stupid mistakes, so ALWAYS PRACTICE BEFOREHAND. -IMHO, Cable owns Doom. Just jump with him and VB/AHVB his photons....if BH assist, jump with Doom and airblock it and wait for Doom to try something....if he does try to throw photons, AHVB or VB...if he doesn't you land before him and can now call your own helper to mess up the order of the Doom/BH trap. -Tron assist is annoying. -Joysticks that are angled to the screen suck. So many people were complaining, and so many people were missing such simple things like AHVBs or Inferno->HOD cancels.... -Arcades need air conditioning. Especially when packed with about 50 people. -I need more sleep.  Well in conclusion, many props to all the players I faced today, including notably Black Rich, Ty, Speedy, that Andrew Kid from Meriden......special props to Ryan for always giving me excellent competition in tournaments (I finally came out on top this time, heh, and I didn't even re-enter to beat you!).....and an extra-special GOOD JOB to Richie for playing MvsC2 so much that he learned how to shut down my Cable with a simple Tron assist. That's one-one now Richie. Next time, it will be for keeps.....  ***Finally, I hope to play a lot of you at CTF this Sunday for the 100Hits MvsC2 tournament. Good luck to all the contenders and hope to see you all there.***  # DarkSyde", "metadata": {"source": "SF2 Google group", "author": "WhoaMoses, Darksyde"}}

{"text": "<YCR>: Today there was a tournament in Meriden....a full state tournament for MvsC2 in Connecticut....this is my log of my personal experiences during the tournament.  The tournament was a surprising success. Even though it was delayed a week (because a button broke last week and the arcade employees were unable to fix it), I think it was honestly the best MvsC2 tournament that has been held in CT. I think just about EVERBODY was there....around 40 people...with the exception of maybe Bobby, Shoubert, Rob Aponte, and Dru....but without a doubt there were people there to take their place anyway. Due to LOTS of traffic delays (the Merritt Parkway was backed up for about a half hour), the tournament started an hour late. The matches were different from last week: to save time, all matches up to the semi-finals would be single fights, while the semis would be best 2 out of 3. Well the tournament started out typically, with regulars like P.J. (Essex on IRC)(Spiral/Magneto/?), me (Darksyde) (Doom/Cyke/Cable), Ryan Lee (Strider/Cyclops/Doom), Brian Jin (Strider/Doom/Cable), Rich Williams (Cable/Magneto/Iron Man), Richie from Waterbury (Cable/Cyke/Tron), a kid named Andrew from Meriden (Magneto/Iron Man/?), and others winning their first round matches without much of a hitch, quickly weeding out most of the scrubs. But to a lot of people's surpirse, some of the more favored players actually LOST their first round matches...Kev (Cammy/Storm/Commando) and others. Why? Well let me explain something about the controllers at Meriden Arcade (Jester's Courtyard). They're DIAGONAL FROM THE SCREEN.

{"text": "<YCR>: The whole truth of the throwing issue is, people used to consider them \"cheap\" in the original SF2 series because:  1. Some characters had huge throw range 2. Originally the throws were inescapable, and since there were no rolls, sometimes you were instantly sent up for another throw....and 3. Throws did huge amounts of damage  Basically, throws could ruin the gameplay of the original SF2 games just because it took away from actual fighting....whether than trying to figure out how to do a nice combo, you would try to figure out how to throw effectively.  But now throws are totally different. For the most part, throw range is minimal in SF and versus games. Throws usually only do about 8-10% damage (with some exceptions, like Commando's in MvsC2 which usually does about 15%, but even then that's not a huge amount). And now nobody has any reason to complain, because throws can be tech hit out of for a large window of time, and even if you miss the tech, you can roll out of most of them to safety. Somebody was complaining about you throwing in MvsC2? That just proves their level of scrubbiness is higher than the average Guile player.

{"text": "<YCR>: Okay, here is what I can remember from the Chinatown fair MvsC2 tournament that took place on August 27th...  It all started at 8AM, when I rushed to the mall to meet Rob Aponte and others, so we could all go to NYC on the train and compete in the MvsC2 tournament at CTF, starting at 12 noon. Well I showed up, and Germaine was the only person there at that point. Soon Mario and P.J. showed up....and that was it. We were like what the hell? So Mario called Rob....who hadn't gotten up yet. Oh great, so a guy that can't even get up when like 6 people are depending on him, is gonna be our leader in NYC? Arg. Well anyways we had about an hour to kill while we were waiting for Rob to come...so I went and picked up Ryan and Speedy (bums without rides). We all met back at the mall around 9 and departed...to stop 5 seconds later, because Speedy's MacDonald's breakfast had spilled sticky syrup all over everybody in Rob's car (luckily I was in Germaine's car because I'm smart). Well after much pants cleaning, we were on our way...to getting lost in Fairfield. Seriously, nobody really knew where the damned train station was, I don't know why we didn't just go to the Bridgeport station, but whatever. We finally found it and took the 10:27 to Grand Central. About an hour and a half ride, but it was all good considering there were a good number of us and we all had stuff to talk about. From Grand Central we took the #6 subway into Chinatown (Canal ST.) and Chinatown Fair was only one street away...we stopped at MacDonalds first because we all had to take a major piss and chow down, then we headed on to the arcade. We arrived at about 12:30.  The arcade was already full of people, but it wasn't very crowded yet. Not much for us to do but sign up....and get a little practice in. We met up with Black Rich, Rob Constant, and Brian Jin inside CTF, but team Waterbury didn't show up...chickened out like the scrubs they are? maybe. Anyways, I headed over to a MvsC2 machine to find Seiya (a 12 year old Boston player and regular on IRC, who talks LOTS of shit) dominating some scrubs. So I headed over and put my coin up...and told him NOT to lose before I got up, so we could have our fabled match. Alas, Seiya was peaced out by Connecticut's own Brian Jin right before my turn.....UWAHAHAH. Anyway I felt bad so I let one of Seiya's crew play against Brian...and he won with a weak team that had Gambit, heh. So then I played and tested him to see what he had...not much besides chipping traps. Which I quickly broke, and it was fairly simple to come back considering I had Cable. A good warm-up, but nothing special.  The tournament finally started, with a total of 66 entrants. Very cramped, very sweaty, very smelly, very LITTLE AC, wtf. Anyways, the sticks were perfect, much better than the ones at ECC2k, so I had nothing to complain about. Generally Connecticut got owned, like I figured most of them would, considering Ryan and I beat them down on a regular basis. I'm not going to go into super-details about all the Connecticut matches because to be perfectly honest, i can't remember most of the ones i wasn't in. You should probably ask those players themselves about their matches. But here's what I can remember:  Rob Aponte won like one match, then his Sentinel/War Machine/Iron Man combinations pretty much got dominated by everybody he faced. Right before a crucial fight with Chocobo (Joe from Virginia, another IRC regular who is deceptively better than he looks), I warned him not to underestimate him. But I doubt he could help it: Chocobo does look like a skinny scrubby white kid, especially wearing that strange green shirt, it looked like he just got off of work serving tables at a restaurant or something. Anyways, to make it short, Rob got his ass whupped, got really disappointed, and all of a sudden he wanted to go home. Heh. Understandable I guess considering how uncomfortable it was being inside there with all those people.  Ryan Lee did a lot better than I think he expected...he made it to the fourth round before he got peaced out. I can't really remember who he fought, but I'm sure a few of his matches were pretty good. I do remember his one fight with Justin, where he dominated the first game with Strider alone....and Team CT almost got kicked out for cheering for him. Heh, whatever, that threat didn't last too long, apologies were made, and everything was cool. Then Ryan lost the next 2 matches to Justin....must have lost his groove. Oh well, I would soon know what that would be like myself.  My first match was against Todd Dwyer, who if any of you somehow don't know, has basically run ECC for the past few years because he works at 8 on the Break in New Jersey. Well he straight out told me that he doesn't play the game much, and I believed him....picking Silver Samurai and Captain American against my Doom/Cable/Cyke/BH teams??? Suicide dood. Sorry to beat you so badly but I had to do it.  My next match was tough, and would prove my skills to the world: Josh W. (Strider/Doom/BH?), a CTF regular and frequent sparring partner of Arturo and company. Basically the matches consisted of trying to out-Doom each other, so I knew it would be tough. The first match he pretty much dominated me, I wasn't ready for his kind of skill yet. But I learned fast, and the second match I had my Doom/BH traps going pretty well. He managed to come back and wipe out both my Doom and Blackheart, leaving only Cable behind...then with only 1 second remaining he called his Strider assist, and I AHVBed on reaction....killing Strider and getting the last second win. The third match was almost like the first, only the opposite...my traps were now in full effect and Josh was having trouble getting out of them. I won that one without much trouble, and to my surprise, I had won a relatively tough fight.  At this point I was starving, and I hate Chinese food, so I went across the street and bought an iced tea for myself. Good enough for now, heh.  My third match was against a guy from Boston named Alex Koo. I had never heard of him and had no idea how he played...so I picked my usual starting team of Doom/Cable/Cyke only to face a deadly combination of Sentinel/Juggernaut/?. Anyways the third character wasn't very important, his Sentinel and Juggernaut were enough to handle on their own. His Sent was almost flawless, keeping me pinned with the FP->Hyper Sentinel Force->FP->Sentinel Force->FP-> Rocket punch etc. shutdown trap working pretty well. There are almost no Sentinels in Connecticut so I was kind of at a loss of what to do....I tried doing photons with doom but he started whacking me out of the air with Sentinel, by flying above me and stomping....its damned hard to get up there with any of the guys I had. I lost the first match pretty badly, so for the second match I used Doom/Cable/BH, I figured that Blackheart assist would be enough to keep Sentinel on the ground...WRONG. Every time I tried to call him out, he would eat a massive Juggernaut punch from a Powerup-glitched jugs for about 40% damage...combine that with Sentinel juggling him with the FPs and HSFs, and he was toast. Well I got mad, I didn't want to go out without a fight, so I did my best....many AHVBs and photon arrays later, it left my 5% doom against his 40% Juggernaut. I had a super, hee hee. I did the only thing I could do: chip a little until he got a super and I feared a headcrush. Time was at like 2 seconds, so I quickly did a full-screen covering jumping RH which somehow crossed up Jugs...then I cancelled into photon array and mashed like crazy. I watched and mashed my brains out....the energy going down down down...and stopping at about 4%. SHIT I yelled out, what do I do now? I'm going to fall right into a headcrush, why won't time run out?!?! All you can do after a photon array at that point is airdash somewhere....and me being a total idiot, instead of airdashing OVER him, I dashed backwards....giving him even more time to do the headcrush and kill me with zero seconds remaining. Oh well. Pretty damn good match for my first loss, and Alex went on to take 3rd place, so I didn't feel so bad.  After that match, I needed food bad, in any possible form available. So I went back across the street to the market with my friend Speedy and bought a huge bag of shrimp-flavored chips, and some cookie-type sticks covered in chocolate called Pocky. Chinese sure have a weird sense of taste. The Pocky were blazin' tho.  My next match was against some guy named Yul Kun or something like that, I really don't know where he was from, but he wasn't bad. We both picked variations of a Doom/Cable/Cyke team, and to make it short, I out-cheaped him. Heh he was disappointed but it was a good fight overall, and I moved on to the fifth round...  I figured since i was going to fight Eddie Lee next (oh boy, time for me to get peaced out) I went across the street to use the bathroom somewhere before my bladder exploded. I went into some Chinese restaurant and asked to use the bathroom. The Chinese guy said something really loud to me in Chinese, like I understand him, wtf. So I just went to the back and used the restroom. When I came out, I said thank you to the guy on the way out of the restaurant, and he gave me a look that just said \"I want to cut off one of your body parts with a huge cleaver. Welcome to Chinatown.\"  Well my match against Eddie was next. At this point the rest of Connecticut had been eliminated (cuz most of them sucked, heh) and I planned to go out soon as well. I was already hella tired, but if I could keep winning, I sure as hell wasn't going to give up now. The match was my Doom/Cable/BH against his Strider/Doom/BH. First match, he tried to do some Strider/Doom trapping on me...I used Cable anti-air to get out, and then started my own Doom/BH trapping...basically I got a lot of AHVBs out on reaction....and through a lot of good timing, I won pretty convincingly. Eddie was just kind of amazed, he seemed almost in a trance for a second after the match ended. Arturo came up to him, and actually said something like \"Eddie, if you lose to Phil, you do realize that your SF days are over, right?\" I think that gave Eddie the drive he needed. Next match I made a lot of mistakes, and Eddie capitalized on them, punishing me appropriately and winning the match even more convincingly than I won the first. Now it was really on, everybody was watching our match intensely. The final match was probably one of the best matches I've ever played. We went back and forth, each catching each other with something or another...I would AHVB, he would do a Strider/Doom trap for a while....I would crossup Photon array, he would get me with a BH inferno->HOD. Finally it came down to his Strider and BH, both at about 25%, to my Cable, which was about 35%, with about 12 seconds left. He was about to start attacking me (which is exactly what I wanted, I needed him to make a mistake I could capitalize on and then AHVB), but just then Arturo yelled out \"TURTLE EDDIE TURTLE!!!\" And so he did. For 12 seconds, Strider super jumped, blocked, and teleported around my Cable, leaving me with no options but to lose. A good fight, very close and very down to the wire, but ultimately I think the better man won. An awesome match, definitely.  At this point I said goodbye to Chinatown Fair and the rest of the 100 Hits tournament. I was tired, dehydrated, starving, sweating like a pig, and almost out of money. I didn't get home until about 3AM because my ride \"didn't want to pay a toll\" to get back to Connecticut so instead got lost in Yonkers and wasted about 5 times the toll in gas money....but I was happy that I had come and represented the skills that I knew I had but could never prove just online or on IRC. After defeating Josh and almost eliminating Eddie Lee, I don't think ANYONE can call me monkeyspank anymore and mean it other than jokingly. The tournament was in my opinion a success, and although I hear that the CTF regulars all clowned out in the finals, leaving 2 Boston heads and a CTF \"scrub\" to take the top three. Whatever, it happens. Much respect for the Boston people who for the MOST PART represented (cough cough SEIYA cough PEACED OUT cough). Props to the CTF regulars who although made mistakes, still gave kick-ass comp. FlashG, if you keep doing those Oro dizzies/juggles on me in 3s....I'm going to complain even more. And lost of thanks to Henry Cen and all the others who ran the tournament fairly well, with only a few delays and NO mishaps with controls or whatever. This tournament definitely is encouraging to me, and now I'm going to make every effort I can to go to the MvsC2 Nationals in Chicago in October.  As always, Nuff' said.

{"text": "<YCR>: I'm sure you're the expert on what was going on in my mind at that time. Well I thought I AHVBed, maybe I'm not remembering correctly, maybe it was a ground HVB, but does it really matter? I saw the opening, reacted, and got the win because Josh made a mistake. Surprised look? Maybe it was from mashing the damn beam so hard. Lucky? Um if people didn't make mistakes, which you seem to consider \"luck,\" then everyone would play perfectly and nobody would ever win....always draw games. And if it was luck, how did I win the third match so convincingly....more luck??? And by the way, who the hell are YOU to call me a scrub? I'm guessing there's a 99% chance you're from Boston. Seriously, Boston showed some excellent and respectable skills at CTF, but you're just putting them to shame.   Okay, now I'm a dumbass for not knowing that Alex posts here? STFU, you've already proved your scrubbiness by trying to flame just because I'm not a regular. As for BH being important, the assist is very important, but the fact is that it didn't matter whether it was BH, or Cable's projectile assist, or any other assist that would keep me on the ground for a second so he could continue the Sentinel lockdown traps.....they all have the same effect. The fact that it was specifically BH that did this, did not matter, which is probably why I couldn't remember who the third character was.   I'm sure you would, considering you're a scrub yourself who flames to make yourself feel better about your lack of skills.  Nuff' said.

{"text": "<YCR>: Okay, if the guy that tried to flame me isn't from Boston, I apologize. I wasn't trying to insult anybody from Boston, it's just that on the day this flame showed up, Seiya was having a fit that I was insulting Boston or something on IRC when I really wasn't. So I apologize if anybody from Boston was offended, you guys represented and showed us some skills we weren't expecting, good work.

{"text": "<YCR>: Heh. I really don't know what you're talking about man. I haven't seen any posts on this NG about Boston being lucky, or sucking, or whatever. It IS true that top players like Justin and Eddie weren't playing as good as they should have...you can't deny that. But that doesn't mean that you guys wouldn't have won anyway....you guys definitely have skills that nobody was expecting, and we respect you for that. I don't know why you think everybody is against you and insulting you....cuz as far as I know, nobody is. Seiya was banned from IRC because he kept complaining that people were insulting Boston....when really nobody was, and finally we just got sick of him complaining, so he got banned. And wtf, you say CT was cheering and everything and then got eliminated....no kidding. I was saying in IRC for months that CT sucks, because we hardly even play the game...usually like once or twice a week we run into each other at the arcade and have good matches. And I NEVER talked shit saying I was the best on the EC...I DID say that I was the best in CT, which is the truth since I got a lot farther at CTF that any other CT player, beating Josh W. and having a close match with Eddie. I know this isn't much, but it's something.  So...in conclusion, STOP WHINING. CTF is over, you guys won, yay. We understand that you have skills and you're good...but we've been hearing about this for a week now and we're kind of getting sick of it. Nobody is insulting you, nobody is clowning you or saying that you got \"lucky...\" If you ask me, you guys are a little paranoid yourselves that maybe it was just luck, and that's why you think everybody is saying that. Well let me outright say it: IT WASN'T LUCK, IT WAS SKILL. You happy now? Geez. If there is ever a Boston tourney (which Seiya said there might be on IRC right before he got banned, heh), post about it here so that we can go and see the true power of Boston on their home turf. I still want my match with Seiya.... Behold the true power of the Darksyde...", "metadata": {"source": "SF2 Google group", "author": "WhoaMoses, Darksyde"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: THE TOP HATERS DOT COM TOP SEVEN MOVIES OF THE SUMMER 2003 SEASON (in no particular order)  1. The Matrix Reloaded - a lot can be said about this film.  It was undoubtedly the most hyped-up movie of this year's blockbuster season.  It can also be said that the plot was long, confusing, and altogether over-important.  Any movie that expects you to sit there and listen to a Colonel-Sanders looking guy for 10 minutes, blabbing about some incomprehensible matrix that you won't understand until you sit there and think about it for another 20 minutes, just thinks WAY too highly of itself.  The acting was off, Keanu sucked like usual (which is probably why he just stood around looking cool for the majority of the movie, or else came out with such awe-inspiring one-liners as \"I don't know what I'm supposed to do\" (an allegory for his acting in this movie) and \"BULLSHIT!!!).  The dialogue was horrible;  if Morpheus' speech to the people of Zion is supposed to be motivational, then Pee Wee Herman could probably motivate us all to marry our salad because we love it so much.  BUT, Reloaded undoubtedly had two of the most awesome action sequences of cinema, ever: the Burly Brawl aka the fight vs 100 Agent Smiths, and of course the Highway scene.  The soundtrack was also perfect, a unique mix of techno and classical that could only be described as the \"perfect dramatic fight music.\"  And, of course, Rage Against the Machine's \"Calm Like a Bomb\" was the perfect closer for the movie.  Love it or hate it, this movie was one of the top 10 biggest this year.  2. Finding Nemo - this was another one a lot of people tend to either love or hate.  Maybe it's because I'm sick of the standard \"make you feel\" Pixar fare of movies...maybe I'm just not impressed with the animation anymore...maybe I think Ellen Degeneres has the most annoying lesbo voice on the planet...or maybe it was my drunken mother drooling and snoring next to me in the theater.  But I just didn't get what everyone else seemed to get out of Finding Nemo.  Don't get me wrong, the characters in the movie are fantastic; the 10-step-program sharks and the hippie sea turtle are faves.  But maybe I'm just tired of having artificial concern and emotion forced down my throat...so Nemo's mother got eaten when he was a baby..so what.  Bad stuff happens to everyone and I just didn't feel for him or his Woody Allen-wannabe dad.  Maybe I also just don't have respect for overprotective parents who are cowards themselves.  I dunno.  One of the best, but sadly I didn't enjoy it much.  3. Bend it Like Beckham - chances are you have no idea what this movie is about.  This is actually an older movie filmed in Britain that was released this summer in the United States.  It stars some unknown Indian chick (who is actually pretty hot when made up) who is trying to get into soccer, but her parents are EXTREMELY traditional Indians who forbid it.  She makes friends with Keira Knightley (the chick who also was the female lead in Pirates of the Carribean, which also made top 7) and together they take the soccer team to the top, getting notice from a scout and eventually going to school in America.  The Indian girl overcomes adversity and convinces her conservative parents to accept her dreams to be a soccer player, blah blah blah.  Pretty standard stuff there.  Where this movie excels is in its portrayal of the traditional Indian family; I can't imagine ANYONE watching this movie and NOT getting a \"culture shock\" of sorts of just how different life is in other parts of the world.  I actually have a few Indian friends and I understand them a lot better now that I've watched this movie.  It's also pretty good for a few laughs, the acting of the two girls is pretty damned good, and the soccer action is entertaining too.  My only complaint is, the movie ends up too romantic and geared towards women...the mush factor turned me off.  But other than that, a superb movie.  4. X-men 2 - this movie was everything that X-men 1 was, and more.  More action, a better plot that didn't lag, more of your favorite mutants like Colossus, Nightcrawler and Lady Deathstryke.  Some awesome special effects in the first sequence with Nightcrawler kicked the movie off into a thriller than kept you guessing what was really going on, or what would happen next.  Pyro's villain turn was a treat, as well as seeing that Phoenix will be in the next film.  They changed Wolvie's backround but didn't BUTCHER it to the point that you want to vomit.  And of course, seeing Magneto with more screentime, and working on the good side, was the shit.  Of all the comic book movies being thrown around, this one is probably only second to last year's Spider-Man.  The DVD has been leaked on the internet; I recommend you run and get it off of torrents.  5. Seabiscuit - now for a total change of pace, Seabiscuit detailed the true-life story of the champion racehorse and it's struggle to make it to the top, only to break his legs and then REGAIN his title as champion against all odds.  But the story didn't revolve around the horse, as much as how the horse affected the lives of the people around it.  Tobey Maguire (Spider-Man) stars in this film of overcoming adversity and other touchy-feely stuffs, but it never overwhelms you with so much mush that you want to go watch Care Bears.  My only complaint is that the film is long, and slow-moving in parts; there are definitely designated \"pee breaks\" if you know what I mean.  But in a summer of explosions, horror flicks and superhero capers, this movie stood out as the drama of note.  6. Freddy vs Jason - by managing to make a totally enjoyable movie, this dream match was one of the best of 2003.  Don't think too much while watching this one, or else you may find yourself missing half of the fun and funny stuff that goes down.  Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the movie for what it is, and you'll see why it ranks in in the top 7.  The integration of classic horror, and then the awesome fight scene between the two horror legends at the end, make this the ultimate slasher-movie for fans of the genre.  DO NOT MISS.  7. Pirates of the Carribean - the movie that everyone thought would suck, ended up being the best of the summer.  At first I thought that making this movie almost three hours long was a big mistake.  But after seeing it, I think it was just fine.  The plot keeps you involved and never bored, although at times it doesn't always make sense (how many times are we gonna go back to that island again???).  Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Rush all do a pretty damned good job in their roles.  But it's Johnny Depp who really shines in this film, playing his partially insane, partially genius Captain Jack Sparrow.  I haven't seen such wacky acting since Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas; in fact Depp's performance of the wobbly and wacky sea captain reminds me of a combination of his character from that movie, and maybe Vash the Stampede.  But the performance is awesome and you can't ignore Depp's skill in this role.  Personally I think he needs to get more serious leading roles so that he can shine; I think his performance in FROM HELL only sucked because his character sucked.  Anyway, surprisingly the best movie of the year, the only thing I can really sad bad about this movie is, a few senseless things happen, but if its for the sake of plot advancement, then I'm all for it.  And now...from the depths...THE STINKERS OF 2003!  1. The Hulk - why oh why oh why must we take a comic book that everyone already knows the plot of, and treat it like nobody does?  The overdramatic plot of Hulk might have worked if we didn't all know what was going to happen...that Bruce Banner was indeed the Hulk and would go through emotional torment...but did we have to see THAT much emotional torment?  I think we stopped caring after the first three cut-off scenes.  The actual Hulk, who should have been the focus of the movie, got about 15 minutes of screen time total, and only had ONE really decent action scene when fighting in the canyon against the helicopters/tanks.  You would think that a guy who was turned into a huge green monster by radioactive rays could GLOW or something so we could actually see the action scenes at night...but no dice.  Instead, what we get is a pretty long, drawn-out, overdramatic movie that makes you snore more than say WOW THATS A FUCKING IMPRESSIVE GREEN GIANT!  Bring your pillows, folks.  2. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen - if it weren't for X-men 2, this movie would have been pretty decent.  The concept is pretty cool, but let's face it, everything LXG did, X2 did better.  All of the characters except for Hyde, Quartermain and Sawyer don't get enough screen time to actually feel for them, or even get to know them.  The most interesting of all the characters, the vampiress, gets the least amount of time.  The plot is pretty good but some of the things that happen in the movie - such as the invisible man walking across frozen arctic tundra with no clothes on, but NOT getting frostbite or dying...and Nemo/Hyde mysteriously being saved from the hulking super-hyde monster when 2 seconds before they were trapped in the tower...is just lame.  Awesome plot twists, but cheesy, nonsensical execution and poor character development ruined this movie from being something great.  3. Dumb and Dumberer - I'm not even going to go into detail here.  I'll just say this: the original starts refused to be in this movie.  4. American Wedding - Do we think that these characters are funny? Yes.  Do we think that high school sex/potty humor is still funny? Yes.  Was this plot played out back before part 2? YES.  Good for a few laughs, but let's face it, there was no reason for a trilogy of these.  5. Terminator 3 - Good start, but let's face it, TALK TO DAH HAND just made this movie ridiculous.  Despite some pretty cool action scenes, this movie had none of what made T2 such a cool movie: characters you felt for, the human aspect to the T-100, an impressive enemy (the T-X just sucked, a combo of a T-100 and a T-1000 that never clearly defined what it was), and a pretty original plot.  Oh yeah, and note to self: don't have an unhappy, anti-climactic ending to your movie, or else people will walk away from the theater feeling depressed and not happy about the movie they just saw.  And now, the #1 stinker is.....  a TIE between BulletProof Monk and the Medallion!  Why do these movies suck so much?  Because both Chow and Jackie were awesome action stars...back in Hong Kong.  Now they've been made into crappy stereotypical asian kung-fu doods who will do anything to be in an American movie and make some cash.  Give me a break, I'd be ashamed to be in these movies after the awesome stuff these two have made.  Hollywood needs to stop trying to make martial arts thrillers and leave it to people who actually know what they're doing...and how to use these superb actors.", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: TH.com Presents: BLACK FRIDAY SPECIAL  November 28, 2003  Ah, yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's that time of year. It's precisely 2:56am on the East Coast, and I'm awake, sadly. Why, you ask? Well, because today is  BLACK FRIDAY!  For those of you too dense to understand what Black Friday is, allow me to explain. It's the single busiest shopping day of the ENTIRE YEAR. And since I work at Circuit City, I have been scheduled from 5:30am to motherfucking 11pm today. All because of you tards.  Why is it your fault? It's pretty simple: year after year, thousands upon thousands of idiots line up outside of retail stores all over the country at 5am the day after Thanksgiving. We're talking people who normally complain when they have to go to work at 8:30am every morning.  As long as they get some physical superficial belonging out of the deal, they're willing to get up before the goddamn son comes up; but if it's for WORK or god forbid SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE, they'll bitch and whine and complain about how they \"went out til 3am last night\" and it's bullshit they have to get up so early.  If people would just grow a brain and realize that Black Friday is the biggest marketing ploy OF ALL TIME then maybe we could cut the BS and I could NOT have to work 17 hours today.  Prepare yourselves, because I'm about to reveal to you.......  THE TRUTH ABOUT BLACK FRIDAY!  That's right, there's a catch to all the merry mayhem, the fighting, the in-store brawls that will occur today. If you think you were heading out to get a deal...YOU WERE WRONG!  Let's start out with something I know a lot about: Circuit City products. Take this one for example:  TODAY ONLY: Western Digital 200gb Internal IDE Hard Drive  Advertised as: In-Store Special - While They Last  you pay $249.99 mail-in rebate(s) -$150.00 price after rebate(s) $99.99  WOW! you say. A 200gb hard drive for $100! Amazing! What a deal!  WRONG!  If you could please open up your eyes for a few goddamn seconds, you would realize just how stupid you are.  First and foremost, this is a mail-in-rebate deal. You will have to pay $250 NOW and then get the $150 back in the mail, as a check, within 8-10 weeks. Now if you're made of money and time is not an issue to you, then that's fine. But to most of us, having to wait three months to get our money back (especially after having to buy a million presents for everyone and being in debt for three months AFTER Christmas anyway), this is a pretty lame deal.  So okay, the rebate thing is acceptable. Now here's the real kicker that I'm sure all of you will love:  THE STORE ONLY HAS FIVE OF THESE IN STOCK!!!  That's right ladies and gents, Circuit City only has FIVE of these babies in-store.  It's prominently displayed all over the web, in the paper ad, on the website...but there's no way that everyone who goes to Circuit City today is going to get one.  Here's the sad truth: 98% of the \"deals\" that you'll find on Black Friday are just marketing ploys. They're used to draw you into the store, so that when you find out they DON'T have what you came for, you at least buy something else.  Only the first five schmucks who lined up outside Circuit City from 4am this morning are going to get their hands on this hard drive; the rest are going to be assed out, and end up either wasting their time, or spending LOTS more money on other stuff (since they already made the trip).  Let's take another ad that I find pretty hilarious myself:  This is a page taken from Best Buy's Black Friday ad:  Some of the deals include:  A Sandisk Cruzer Mini USB 256mb Flash Drive for $49.99  A 256mb Secure Digital memory card for digital cams, regularly $109, for $49.99  And lots of other stuff. NONE of this is after rebate, by the way; it's all INSTANT SAVINGS.  Well, it's also another marketing ploy that you dumbshits fall for.  Here's the catch: NONE OF THESE ITEMS CAN BE FOUND AT ANY BEST BUY. If you don't believe me, go to Best Buy.com and search for these items. You will either get one of two things: OUT OF STOCK for any store location you type in (I tried), or COMING SOON.  Coming motherfucking soon.  Explain one thing to me: how can you advertise a sale at your store, for an item that isn't even AT your fucking store? YOU KNOW it's not there, your website blatantly says that it's not. Yet you advertise that it is, and it's on sale, with no remorse. You purposely fool the consumer into rushing into your store, just to be sadly disappointed when the item that was heavily advertised does not even exist yet. BUT, chances are they'll at least buy SOMETHING for the trouble of coming to your store.  That's the truth about retail: stores make NOTHING on what they advertise. What they do make money on, is extended warranties and accessories for all that shit they advertise as \"on sale.\" When you come in to get that awesome IPod that's on sale for $250 today, the store could care less; what they'll make money on is the USB adapter you buy, the CDS you buy to rip and put on it, and the extended protection plan that you purchase.  SO what does the store lose by having a few hundred extra people coming in, looking for deals, and finding none? Nothing at all. Thousands upon thousands of people will dash into retail stores all over the country today, only to find the shelves empty of what they were looking for. What they WILL find are expensive replacement products that aren't on sale, and plenty of accessories, and salespeople harassing the shit out of them to buy that pricey \"Protection Plan\" that protects nothing but that store's fat wallet.  OKAY. So you got up early today and got fucked. What do you do?  I'm going to let you all in on the secret of the smart consumer:  The best time to shop is not Black Friday, but THE WEEK BEFORE BLACK FRIDAY, and ON THE INTERNET.  This week, I frequently visited two of my favorite websites: www.passwird.com and www.fatwallet.com  Both of these websites are discount-seekers, who list when they find deals at rock-bottom prices, or nice online coupons for $20 off $100, or similar things.  Here's just a few of the things I got this week, online. Keep in mind, I never dealt with one salesperson, I never got up at 4am and waited outside of a store in the freezing cold. And I sure as hell didn't fight for one of the five items in fucking stock. By the way, ALL of these orders featured FREE SHIPPING:  -Canon SD100 3.2 Megapixel Digital Camera, with 128mb SD memory card and extra battery. $425 value for $299, minus a $50 coupon for a grand total of $264 after tax.  -160gb Maxtor Internal Hard Drive, $110 before $30 mail-in-rebate.  -NEC dual format Black Bezel DVD burner, $104, PLUS free headset with mic.  Now, compare those deals with the ones you see above. The difference is, I never have to leave my house to get the items, and they're all in fucking stock. I'm not going to get screwed and find out the website only had five of each item to begin with. Instead, I'm going to get a shitload of stuff, and never have to set a foot inside of a store to get it.  In summary, Black Friday is just a marketing ploy by retail stores to fuck you. They want you in their store so you'll buy SOMETHING, so they advertise a shitload of stuff they don't have, or have very limited quantities of.  So you end up going out expecting to save, and you come home broke, and with totally different stuff than what you wanted in the first place. Be smart, and order online BEFORE the rush next year.  And now, I present...  THE TOP HATERS DOT COM \"BLACK FRIDAY FUCKED ME\" PHOTO CONTEST!  That's right ladies and gents! For the first time ever, TH.com is holding a contest for our readers.  Send in some interesting pictures from your Black Friday experiences today...juicy stuff like people fighting over items, people getting knocked on their asses, or shelves totally empty at 6:03am.  The pics will be posted here in a future article, and the one lucky person who I choose sends in the best shot will receive something very, very nice.

{"text": "<YCR>: In response to Infinite:  The vids weren't put up because they weren't mine. Neither were the ones from CTF. I have an analog camcorder thats a bitch to encode on a computer, so I rarely use it. The first time it was Ryan who quickly encoded the vids and sent them to me. Then I sent to FMJ and had them hosted, and linked on top haters. I really did nothing to produce that first batch of videos.  The vids from the Break triple-threat were Kong's. Kong doesn't even have a computer and wouldn't be able to upload them. I asked him for over two weeks for the camera, and he finally gave it to me during the third week. Then I realized why he hadn't wanted me to put up the vids so fast: The quality sucked. Worse than my analog cam. I think his digital camcorder is old or fucked up or something, but whenever he recorded on the big screen at the break, there was major distortion. So much that it wasn't even worth encoding them because it was so blurry and shitty. I would have loved to encode them and especially the Sanford vs Justin finals but they were just too ugly to bother with.  What's strange is that the interviews came out fine. Anything AWAY from a game screen looks good, but all the game footage was shitty as hell. It would have been pretty pointless for me to encode interviews that relate to a grudge match with no/bad footage, wouldn't it?  Now to Blaziniflo:  I'll play you at ECC for any amount of money. You name it and I'll match it. You are such a guaranteed win that I'm not even going to front: if you play me, you're done.

{"text": "<YCR>: COSPLAY: The Nerds, The Fags, and the Ugly (mostly the Ugly)  Sound Labs new \"dweeb attractor\" whistle is so high pitched, it can only be heard by these fucking idiots.  If you don't yet know what Cosplay is, you're lucky.  The \"technical\" definition is to dress up like an anime and/or manga character, using authentic clothes that replicate their ridiculous outfits in the non-real world.  This also includes any ridiculously large swords, wacky hairstyles, or anything else that cannot exist properly in this plane of existence.  Of course, these morons don't seem to get the picture.  First of all, why do people cosplay? What kind of fun can you possibly get out of spending hundreds of dollars on an \"authentic\" costume of your favorite anime/manga character?  If you haven't noticed yet, anime is FANTASY, not reality.  Halloween is once a year; you're not going to score any extra points for trying to pull off looking like some imaginary character all the time.  I can't imagine the kind of person that would actually enjoy doing something like cosplay; it's a waste of time, money, and self-dignity.  Wait, I take it back, I DO know the kind person that would enjoy something like that:  Exhibit A: The Cosplay Dork  This is your typical cosplayer: fat, stupid, UGLY and so much of a dweeb that the only social interaction he can get is to dress up in fucking drag and drive 40 hours across the country to meet up with other transsexual nerds.  This is the kind of guy who sits behind his computer on IRC wishing he was cool and trying to be friendly with all the girls, while incessantly stuffing Yodels in his face all day in real life. He actually thinks that what he's wearing right now is funny rather than pathetic and revolting.  A sad, sad man.  The sadder part is that he's probably a closet homosexual...who else would attend a cosplay convention?  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for conventions and shit.  Anime/manga/comic book conventions celebrate important aspects of the pop culture of our world during the past 50 years or so.  But what the FUCK makes it so cool to dress up like a fool? You don't even get any goddamn candy for it; all you get is your picture on the internet and a million people who don't even know you, making fun of your dork ass behind your back.  I can't imagine what would possess a person to participate in cosplay, besides being so amazingly bored with life that you have hundreds of dollars to waste and hundreds of hours to spend with your fellow dorks, acting like you're cool and socially accepted while in reality, you're just a silly faggot fooling yourself..  Exhibit B: The random hot chick  This picture shows:  A. A hot chick showing off  B. A hot chick making this homely-looking chick look bad  C. The guy above's wet dream  The correct answer is, of course, D. NONE OF THE ABOVE.  That girl is a fucking DWEEB AND A HALF, not a hot chick.  Any self-respecting hot girl who would dress up like that has to be on some kind of drugs, and she looks pretty straight to me. If you were to meet this girl in real life, talking to her for more than five seconds may result in either 1. a sudden outbreak of uncontrollable narcolepsy or 2. your brain liquefying instantly and beginning a slow dribble out of your inner right ear canal. This is unfortunate, because if she were not a total loser, this girl would actually be a hot piece of ass.  If I were to fuck this girl, I would have to fuck her RIGHT IN THE POOPSHOOT because actually sticking my dick in her pussy would probably reflect some kind of respect for her, and that's something I definitely don't want to do.  All hail the king of Dorkland! Beware my sleeves of satin, infidels! THEY CHAFE!  The really disturbing part about Cosplay conventions is that they're basically just a precursor to free sex.  I've heard from sources that they're nothing but a front for a lot of wacky sex and orgies.  Pretty much everyone who attends a cosplay convention gets laid.  Sounds cool, right? Dress up and act like a fool for a day and get some hot pussay? Well, sadly, 99% of the people at these events look like this:  So you get all the sex you want from THESE guys.  God save us all.  And the girls pretty much make that hideously ugly chick from the Drew Carey show look like Jennifer Love Hewitt.  I can get hotter sex from my next-door-neighbors great dane, if I set my dick on fire first before plunging into the bitch.  So, in conclusion, cosplay is bad news.  It's for the biggest losers on the planet, it attracts the ugliest antisocials together for free sex, it costs too much, and it's pointless.  On top of all that, you can pretty much expect to find your fucking ridiculous-ass picks somewhere on the internet to be made fun of.  AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE, and the next time you see a cosplayer, punch him in the gut for me.  If we all follow this simple rule, soon all the cosplayers' guts will be too sore to fit into those gay-ass costumes.", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}

I live in New Haven a few blocks away from all the clubs.  SO WHAT IS UP???", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: Unfortunately CT is full of unreliable gamers. Case in point: Everybody shows up at What's Your Game at 10:30pm and nobody wants to pay to play. Instead, everyone convinces me to leave and we go back to my apartment in New Haven and play for free until 8am. I'm not complaining, I needed the practice, but the fact of the matter is that very few gamers are serious enough about SF anymore to care.  Yet, if it's FREE they'll play all friggin' night.  As much as I'd love to get things going again, I don't see it happening. Having a few console setups at What's Your Game is nice, but I really doubt that Neil (the owner) is going to end up making any money on it, or that anyone will consistently start coming to play 3s on that cabinet either. It's great that he fixed it, but with consoles that you can play on FOR FREE, why would anybody pay to play?  Plus you're forgetting the biggest problem: CT is, and always has been, primarily MvC1/MvC2 players. Very few people in the state are willing to try anything new. In fact, the ONLY players here who have even tried to play other games are myself, Walter, Ryan, Dru, Tony Barnage, James Austin, and Josh. And of course Nestor when he considered himself from CT. Since 80% of that list lives over an hour from What's Your Game, and we ALL own PS2s, I doubt that we're going to get anything going without having an MvC2 cabinet there.  The reason people eventually stopped going to What's Your Game wasn't because the arcade scene was dying, but because Neil stopped having people repair the MvC2 machine. EVERY time we came in it was broken, so we had nothing to do. Neil's major problem is that he's wishy-washyat one point he was gung-ho for getting every single fighting game, then he didn't want to buy anything. At the time of Super Street Fighter II/Super Turbo he wasn't buying anything at all (that's why What's Your Game never had those machines), but then he buys massive quantities of Mortal Kombat, Killer Instinct, and other stuff. Then again, when CvS1 came out, he took forever to get it and then fell victim to it being one of the worst fighting games in history. He then bought Dead or Alive 2 for some god-awful reason and lost a lot of money on that.  What's Your Game finally fell off when Neil bought SvC. Nobody told him to, but he just did. I tried to get people to start coming again, so we could go between MvC2 and SvC, and it worked for a couple of weeks. But then we got tired of the shittyness of SvC and MvC2 never worked, so we gave up and stopped going. That was well over a year ago.  The only way that What's Your Game is going to get stuff going again, is to get one or more QUALITY MvC2 cabs in there. Once you have that, and you're making steady weekend income on them, and you KEEP THE CONTROLS WORKING, we can branch out and have events like the $5 console casuals, weekend tournaments, etc. But without having that MvC2 staple present, I really doubt anybody is going to show up for anything.  Oh yeah, and Guilty Gear IS gay. A bunch of half-naked men running around in Cosplay outfits fighting in retarded fashion, and anime fanboys like it because of the Japanese-animation style, and not for the gameplay. Pretty gay if you ask me. Besides, it's just a beefed up version of MvC1 with too many moves.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: You have to understand that when I make comments, I'm not talking about EVERY SINGLE player in the Guilty Gear community. People always take it like that.  Perfect case in point: after all the drama with the James Austin thing, and after I was forced to ban him from ECC for his own good, I have had nothing but grief from Guilty Gear players.

People on the guilty gear message boards are saying no.\u201d  So now I have to go and defend ECC again saying there IS Guilty Gear.

I'm not willing to put that kind of risk out there because it could potentially RUIN ECC and its reputation.  But stupid, favortistic assholes in the Guilty Gear community are out to destroy ECC.

I was banned from the Guilty Gear websites so I can't even track down what these idiots are saying about ECC and defend the tournament.

I moved to New Haven for a while but then I got a new job down here so I moved back.  You're right, I am a pretty busy guy. Weekdays are 100% out due to work and working out and other stuff. The only time I play is usually on weekends, and usually it's not in CT. Since last EVO, this past year has been crazy busy with tournaments and stuff. Just for example, this weekend is an event at TGA in Massachusetts, then on the 28th I'm running the Web2Zone event, ECC next month etc. Lots of places to go if you are looking for comp.  Chinatown fair is OKAY. Not great anymore. They haven't fixed the controls there in ages. Everything works but it's all worn out. They still have buttons on the Capcom vs. SNK 2 machine that have been there since the day the game came outin 2001. So that should give you an idea of why I don't think very highly of Chinatown anymore. However there are still lots of locals that go there. It's just not very hype like it used to be back in the day.  Honestly the only active Marvel players in CT right now are myself and Tony B. Tony lives up in Preston but he usually comes out for the tournaments (he'll be at TGA and web2zone). Besides that pretty much EVERYONE has \u201cretired\u201d which basically means they got women who have them pussywhipped and tell them they can't play games anymore. Which I find hilarious :rofl: but what can you do.  My MAJOR game right now is Super Street Fighter II Turbo. I got 5th place at EVO in 2005, won the EVO East qualifier last year and got 9th at Worlds. I do still play Marvel but I haven't really played it at all until very recently. At EVO in Vegas this year I have a $500 marvel money match lined up, so I have to start playing that game again so I don't choke. I also play Capcom vs SNK2 and SF3: Third Strike, but I'm nowhere near as good in those games.  Anyway yeah Rob it's great to see you on SRK. Pretty much for the past couple of years CT has been almost totally dead Street Fighter-wise and I've had to start travelling like crazy to get competition. Maybe on an off weekend when there's no tournaments going on we can get some Marvel players together.

Standard double elimination tourney since this is usually the lowest headcount and the tournament runs fast enough anyway. However, unlike other games, ST will be best 3 out of 5 games instead of 2 out of 3, throughout the ENTIRE tournament. -MVC2 will have a very similar format to an evolution Tournament. With one exception. . NO ROUND ROBINS There will be 16 different qualifying pools, double elimination each. With a 32 man tourney Sunday at 12pm sharp!!! When we get to final 8 we will take a BRIEF intermission and then continue.  -after the second round of winner's bracket, there will be no floating, except to avoid double jeopardy. If double jeopardy is unavoidable, you must play your match or you forfeit.      again, more information will be released as it comes up. if you have any questions, please post here.     for console tournaments, you must supply your own controller, plus we are not responsible for controller malfunctions read: if it stops working, it's your problem     -HUGE UPDATE: THERE WILL BE NO FORFEITS AT ECCXI. This means, if Justin Wong and Ricky Ortiz get 1st/2nd in a tournament, THEY MUST PLAY OUT THEIR FINALS. It is unfair to the gaming community for people to not play out their finals. Therefore, if it is determined that there is a forfeit or a \u201cthrown match\u201d in finals, it is totally up to the discretion of the tournament staff whether or not prizes will be awarded, or stripped. So, PLAY YOUR DAMNED MATCHES!     -HUGE UPDATE: Since there will be a lot of console tournaments this year, the issue of \u201cgame pausing\u201d will undoubtedly come up. Here is the deal: If there is a game pause, a tournament official MUST get involved. The official will determine whether or not the players both mutually agree to continue playing the game, in which case he will supervise the \u201cunpause\u201d and continuance of the match. If both players do not agree to unpause and continue, then a mutual agreement must be made between both players and the tournament official on how to proceed. Do NOT unpause the game without a tournament official present - this constitues cheating, because you could easily pause, pretend it's a mistake, then unpause when your opponent is not ready and land a cheap attack. Both players MUST be ready for the unpause, so an official MUST be present to supervise. Be warned that if there is random pausing/unpausing without any supervision, all results are subject to CANCELLATION and DISQUALIFICATION by the tournament staff.     -One more note: Look, we've all been through this before. We are running pool-style tournaments this year so you know when you are going to be playingBE AROUND when it is time for your pool to play.

{"text": "<YCR>: Ok guys, here's the deal on a LOT of stuff, mostly the stuff I'll be running.  Basically I'll be in charge of CvS2, ST, DOA4, and probably will have a hand in 3s as well. Also, I'm going to try to run several side tournaments. Here are the updates that you need to know:  CvS2: Will be held on the PS2 console Since it's being held on console, we will have more than enough stations to have 2 out of 3 games (which will eliminate all the problems we've had with the single match CvS2 the past couple of years). Also, I am strongly considering having a CvS2 teams if there is enough interestthis means, 8 LEGIT teams of 3 players each. I will need to have enough people to hold the tournament previous to ECC or else I will just not run it. I will be putting up the ECCXI website with pre-registration SOON so we can get an actual headcount.  ST: will be $10 entry and 3 out of 5 games for the entire tournament. For the finals it will change to sets of 4 out of 7. ST is arguably the fastest game ever to be held in a tournament, so there is no reason to not do 3 out of 5. It WILL be held on Sunday (none of that Friday bullshit from last year) and I WILL be having an ST teams at the same time as you register for singles. The ST teams will take place immediately following the singles ST tournament. We will have at least 2 cabs and SWITCH STICKS for this tournament, so we will all be set.  DOA4: this will be the FIRST time that DOA4 will be featured at a fighting game major, and hopefully will pave the way for further participation at other majors. The games will be 3 out of 5 rounds, 2 out of 3 matches, until semis that will change to 3 out of 5 matches. The damage will be STANDARD. I don't care if there's a huge argument in the DOA community that damage should be either standard or max life, I'm putting my foot down on this and you're either getting a three-round and standard life, or else if there is enough uproar we will just do two-round on max life. The game was obviously designed by Tecmo to be played on standard life or else it wouldn't be standard; if you have problems with this, don't enter and miss out on the first major DOA4 tournament. SPECIAL RULES: Since this is going to be held on the Xbox 360 you ABSOLUTELY MUST BRING YOUR OWN PADS. I am not going to donate pads to be destroyed at this tournament, sorry. Button mapping will be allowed for DEFAULT SETTINGS ONLY. This means you can use the triggers to what they are mapped to as a default, and nothing else. WHY? because I don't have time to sit around and let people map buttons every single match, that will literally double the time it takes to run the tournament. The default button settings give you more than enough shortcuts, you don't need anything extra, and we don't have all weekend. It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you bring WIRED 360 pads/joysticks because 1. you will get faster response time and 2. I have no idea how having multiple 360s all trying to synch with separate wireless controllers is going to workI just imagine a huge problem where mutiple 360s are recognizing the same controllers, etc. SO BRING YOUR BEST GAME AND BRING YOUR WIRED CONTROLLERS!  As for the bonus tournaments  I will most likely be holding both Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Street Fighter Alpha 3 on a spare cabinet, and they will probably be held on Sunday since that day has the least amount of SF tournaments right now.  Third Strike: will 100% be held on the PLAYSTATION 2 CONSOLE. I am tired of people complaining about the 360 controls on the cabinets at the break so this will leave no excuses. If you have a problem with playing on console for 3s and are going to whine and complain, DO NOT COME TO ECCXI FOR 3S. I am sorry but we are putting our foot down here, having 3s on console is only going to save time and benefit the largest amount of gamers possible.  FINALLY  If you come to ECCXI and donate at least a 19\" TV that we use for the tournament  OR  If you dontate an Xbox 360 console with DOA4, or a PS2 with copies of 3s or CvS2  you will receive free entry into one tournament. If you bring a COMBO of items (you bring a tV and a PS2 with a game for example) you will receive TWO free entries. Basically, a tv, ps2/game, and xbox360/game each earn you one free entry. We will be HEAVILY depending upon people's help to get this event running, so we will DEFINITELY be willing to compensate you for your help.  LAST BUT NOT LEAST, please for the love of God BRING YOUR OWN CONTROLLERS FOR CONSOLE TOURNAMENTS. Any of you who are coming to ECC have undoubtedly at this point played these games on console and should have appropriate controllers to bring. If you are coming with a group of friends, have designated joystick to share between you. There MAY be a chance of spare joysticks at the tournament (if I'm feeling like being a giving person and I let you use some of my stuff) but last year there was a lot of complaining that people were playing on other people's sticks and losing because \u201cIt's not a perfect 360\u201d or \u201cI can't play on a Hori.\u201d Well guess what, if you're borrowing stuff to play, that's the price you have to pay. Bring your own stuff and then you won't have to worry about that. If I get one complaint that there's no joysticks or controllers to play on I'm going to laugh in your face and give you 1 minute to find something to play on or else get DQed. And I'm not joking!  Ok, that's all I can think of for now, but I'm sure there will be more to come!", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: Tekken is going to be held on console. If there is not console release of DR before ECCXI, it will be standard Tekken 5. Nothing I can do here, there aren't enough Tekken machines in Jersey to be holding DR on arcade :sad:  Blame Namco and Sammy for being retards and not releasing shit, I would love to have the new games, but they have to fucking release them first!", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: First, I take offense for you to be even coming on here and be like \u201chey, do you guys care?\u201d Would we have taken the responsibility of running this if we didn't care? Now, I read your actual post and see that you are pretty much 100% wrong on every point.  The reason Guilty Gear is being held on Friday is this: the majority of GG players, with the exception of Chaz and maybe a handful of others, do NOT play Capcom games at all. Why crowd these players into the break on the weekend, when there will be 5x as many people, and 1/5 the amount of open T.Vs? It just doesn't make any sense at all. Just like Wigfall said, at TS6 Slash was held AT A TOTALLY SEPERATE LOCATION on Friday night, and people came out from all over and played until 8:30 in the morning. We're running Slash on Friday because we're trying to be CONSIDERATE and give the guilty gear players free reign of the break, so they can have some casuals, have plenty of space to play and set up, and then have a nice tournament. OR, we could try to just throw them into the mix of 5+ other console tournaments over the weekend and give then no casuals, limited space, and a long ass wait. HRM, which is better?  CvS2 will be a double elim tournament, as it should be and always has been. We're not going to get 90+ heads like Texas or Evolution, so there's no reason to do pools. Pools do nothing but take up more time, and with the limited time and space we will have, I'm not willing to run pools. CvS2 players should be happy they're getting 2 out of 3 games for the first time in a LONG time, so please stop bitching.  ST is on Sunday for one reason: there are already way to many things going on Saturday between MvC2, CvS2, and 3s, not to mention casuals. If we run ST on Sunday, we can also have Alpha 2 and 3 that daythe majority of players who play ST will also be interested in those games. It will be IMPOSSIBLE to do this on Saturday with the amount of work we'll already be doing. I've already had a few people thank me for putting ST on Sunday so they could also enter A2 and A3.  3s is console 100%, and we've said this 10 times already. It will 1. save time, 2. avoid people whining about the Break's sticks (which happens 100% of the time), and 3. give people a chance for 3s casuals on the cabinets DURING the tournament. At what other tourney do you get to practice the game you're about to play moments before your match? The minor differences between the PS2 and arcade version of 3s are so ridiculously small that even the Japanese players don't care about themif you're some kind of a meticulously detail-focused person who is going to bitch, don't come. The major complaints I've had about 3s are NOT about game differences, but about people who aren't used to playing on joysticks! Um, 3s has been on console for about 7 years now, time to get used to it I think  As for DOA4, I really don't think it's going to be Friday, I'm probably going to change it to Sunday. You are 100% wrong when you said that DOA4 players play Tekken; in fact, VERY FEW players play both besides probably Jason Cole. The DOA4 players are going to come just for DOA4 and nothing else, so I'd rather do it midday Sunday or something like that. Although there's a possibility I may do it Friday night as well, but I have to make a solid decision soon.  So, let me explain to you what would happen if we used your schedule:  Friday: Nobody shows up and the arcade is nearly empty all day. We miss out on valuable time we could be finishing a tournament or two, because honestly, nobody cares about team tournaments.  Saturday: We are ridiculously pressed for time and space, trying to run both CvS2 and Tekken 5 simultaneously. We are also ridiculously crunched for space trying to run 3s on cabs, because the cabs are small and the controls suck. We get 1 million complaints about 360s on 3s and once again, people shit all over the tournament. ST goes smooth, but then it ends around 8-9pm and we have no time to have A2 or A3. CvS2 does not finish because of lack of TVs/consoles/joysticks while Tekken was running and spills over into Sunday. We try to squeeze in DOA4 and that ends up taking forever because we only have one station for it, due to lack of space. Nobody is happy besides Marvel players, who spent most of the day doing money matches and drinking.  Sunday: Nobody shows up for MvC2 until 2pm (they all drank the night before) and it takes forever to get the tournament started. We should have started top 16 at 8pm, but it didn't start until 10 because we're behind. CvS2 had to finish so we had a very late start with Gulity Gear, and those people are pissed. Plus, we had to force the CvS2 top 16 to play immediately after the end finishing quals because we're strapped for time, giving them no rest at all. In addition, nobody shows up for A2/A3 because the ST players have mostly gone home already. Marvel finishes after midnight, everybody is tired, and turnout for a lot of games was ruined.  So  In conclusion, thanks for the advice, but no thanks. We know what we're doing, we didn't just magically make a schedule for no reason. If you wanted to talk to us about this, it's called an IM or a PM or hell, call me on the cell. Don't go on SRK trying to blast us and make us look stupid, because you just made yourself look even worse.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: Last year we also didn't have CvS2, 3s, and DOA4 on console. It is UNFAIR to these gamers to force them to play on Saturday/Sunday when I know there will be next to no time to pay attention to their tournament. I'm sorry that the New Jersey community can't make it, really, but it's called a MAJOR because it's three days. If you can't make it the day of your tournament, tough shit. Remember I didn't even want to have this tournament, but thanks to Josh Wigfall and Chaz campaigning for it, it's going to happen. I have nothing against the Guilty Gear community but I'm not going to sacrifice the \u201cbig 4\u201d aka the four major capcom games for this game. ECC was founded on Street Fighter and will forever be based around Street fighter. If they have a problem with that, tough shit. I'm trying to give them the most help possible here, and if they don't understand that, to hell with it!   One thing you're forgetting: we will have at least 3-4 CvS2 stations at all times. Yes it's slightly harder to run, but I'm SORRY I dont' believe we're getting 80 entries. I dont' know what crack you've been smoking but ECC hasn't had 80+ people in a tournament for years. I like how you can quote mythical facts but you are wrong, lol.   People will ALWAYS complain no matter what. The difference is, for console you can simply say \u201cyou played on your own stick/you SHOULD have played on your own stick\u201d and it's over. For arcade, you have to eat the blame for shitty controls. But I'm sure you don't see the difference since you've never taken blame   In texas, the only person who played in both was Jason Cole, and I regularly check the actual DOA forums and haven't seen much about overlapping tournaments. Perhaps the Tekken tournament holders just like to hold DOA4 as a secondary event? I haven't heard jack about this and nobody has posted saying that they'd like DOA4 the same day as Tekken besides you. SOif people feel that way, please request it.   Which is why I'd rather have Guilty Gear in a relatively empty arcade than in a jam-packed sardine can. If you can't see the logic behind this, you're probably not a logical person.   We can solve this in several different wayseither we can cancel Tekken 5 entirely (I have no problem doing this, ESPECIALLY since so many people will be complaining that it's not DR, which you can blame Namco for making PSP-only) or else we can try to swap the time of Tekken 5, but I'd much rather run CvS2/3s on Saturday so if either spills over, we can finish on Sunday. AGAIN, ECC is focused on the BIG FOUR and nothing else, everything else can suck a dick and these games get preferential treatment because they have been staples of ECC (in one form or another) since it's inception. I'm not going to cancel 3s for Tekken, so to speak. Also, if Tekken Zaibatsu people don't have brains enough to remember ECC, that's pretty fucking lame. Honestly, if they dont care, we don't have to have it and I can run something else   Just because someone brings their own equipment, it doesn't create magical timeyou can bring 100 copies of Slash and modded PS2s, but if we have limited space it doesnt mean jack shitthe issue is time and space, NOT copies of games.   YES and I'm sure you've never played 2-3 tournaments back to back EVER! At TS6 I played ALL of my MvC 2 matches, then a ST match, then some DOA matches, then all of my 3s matches, the more DOA4 matches, THEN at 12:30am I was expected to finish my ST matches all back to back. Get the fuck out of here! If you want to have a real, meaningful tournament, you need to have players NOT overtired and overplayedany REAL player realizes this. Sorry you don't get it, bro!   Yes, people will always complain, but at least with my schedule we can defend ourselves and say \u201cat least we tried to split shit up, it's not our fault.\u201d With your schedule it's trying to do all the console shit in 1 day and it's bound for failure.   Then you're experience is absolutely shitty. Get your head out of your butt and realize that you're looking from the perspective of 1-2 tournies only.   I'd much rather make my own mistakes than suffer because I listened to somebody else. Josh and I stand by our schedule and if there's issues, we'll take the blame. Much better than saying \u201cFUCKING ROB SIGLEY FUCKED UP ECC!\u201d See, we're men who take fault for shit that happens, we don't blame it on others.

{"text": "<YCR>: I hardly believe that a post starting with \u201cdo you guys even care about ECC?\u201d is trying to give constructive criticism.

When you open a post by shitting on someone's face and reputation, it doesn't really matter what you say afterwards, it's going to be taken as diarrhea.  The major points that Rob madethat 1. he doens't think Guilty Gear will get many entries on Friday, and 2. that 3s should be on arcadeare not valid. With all the console tournaments going on already that MUST go on (when I say that, I mean the \u201cbig four\u201d and Tekken) there is no time to cram in Guilty Gear as well. And 3s will be on console, 100%. I don't know how many times I have to say it, both Josh and I have decided on this and set it in stone. The amount of people whining about console 3s is miniscule compared to the amount of people who have said \u201cthank god, now I can actually play instead of fucking up on shitty 360s and cramped cabinets.\u201d  It is also insanity to try to cram MvC2 into one day, and I stand behind Wigfall on that. Also running pools for every game takes MASSIVE time, since you have to create 8+ fair pools of seeded players from different regions, and thats just ridiculous. It's going to take me 2x the amount of time it will take for me to create a double elim bracket, and it will also take 2x as long to run the tournament, since basically there will be people losing more than twice but still playing. It just doesn't make sense in this kind of venueagain, if we were at EVO in a big hall with lots of space, and 10+ stations to play on, I would run pools, but it makes no sense at the Break. We're going to try to cram in 5-6 console stations as it is but we'll be lucky if we can do even that.  I am HAPPY to accept constructive criticism. But Rob apparently doens't know how to go about it in a human manner. Wigfall IMed me the other day basically saying that Sigley shit on us like we're assholes that dont' care about ECC and he's not happy about it. At first I thought he was overreacting until I read the thread myself. It's great that Rob is trying to help, but I think HE needs help with his personal skills a bit.

{"text": "<YCR>: A lot of replies:  I really didn't figure that putting up posters at the break was going to affect anything, everybody knows when and where ECC is and you pretty much have to go to SRK to figure out the details anyway, regardless of flyers. Maybe putting up flyers at the break would bring an additional 5 people, but exactly as you've said, neither of us live in NJ near the break, so we had no means to put anything up anyway. As for other promotion, why do you think Josh and went to TS6, are going to Final Round, etc.? We are talking up a storm about ECC.      After talking with Phi last night, pools are a good idea, just not round robin. The reason I was 100% against pools here is because pools in the very sense means round robinwhat Phi has been doing the past few years is really 8 mini-double-elim brackets, of whom the winner of winners finals and losers finals qualify for top 16, which resets. I have nothing against this style of running the brackets as opposed to one huge double elim bracket, and since most players in the Pools poll seem to want pools, this is what we will go for. But full round-robin pools will NOT be happening due to time constraints.      Guilty Gear entries really don't matter to me in the least. I don't know if you remember, but I was actually staunchly against even running Guilty Gear this year. It gets the least number of entries a lot of the time, it takes up lots of consoles and space, we need specialized consoles to have it (every one must be a Japanese PS2) and then usually the players split after the tournament, so we don't even get to keep using their stuff for other tournamentsa big hassle when you have to start switching shit around when you're trying to finish other games. ECC is, and always has been, a Capcom-centered tournament, and as long as the BIG FOUR get run properly - that is, CvS2, MvC2, ST and 3s - then we will be fine. However, after I proposed not having Guilty Gear, every fucking whiny player on the planet flamed me saying that I was being biased. So, since this game is the most intrusive of all games that will be played at ECC since we need to use Japanese equipment, we need to have it at a time that will not interfere with anything elseFriday. Pair that with the fact that the Guilty Gear players will not be forced to hang around the Break with non-Guilty Gear players, in a smelly and crowded environment, and will actually get some casual play in beforehand, and you've actually got a good deal if you play the game.  Seriously, the \u201cI can't come on Friday\u201d argument is really weak to me. Last year, fucking SUPER TURBO was held on Friday and half the ST players didn't even show up, and the sticks on only 2/3 cabinets worked. ST is one of the BIG FOUR and it got shit-ass treatment. But those who were dedicated ST players took the time off from work and got their asses to the Break. Street Fighter players have been making sacrifices for years to play their games, so don't give me the sob story argument about how Guilty Gear players have lives too and they can't take Friday off, because I've been there every year since I started going to ECC and any other 3-day fighting game major. If they can't make it, then they are not dedicated enough players or they don't have the balls to take Friday off, I don't know what to tell you. ECC is not going to be dictated to by a handful of players who want to be pampered rather than sacrifice to keep their community alive.  If you really want to appeal to someone, it's got to be Chaz from NYC. Chaz got 3rd at Slash in Texas and he's going to be directing Slash at ECC. So if these Guilty Gear players have so many problems with a Friday tournament, have them contact him somehow. You know how I feel on the issue.      No, nobody has talked to Chris, because as soon as Wigfall and I announced that we wanted to run ECC since Phi was not doing it anymore, it was quickly changed to \u201cPhi has made up a team of guys to run ECC this year so he gets some time off.\u201d Phi even said it to me in that way in an IM yesterday, which kind of made me do a double take, because I really did think that this thing was 100% in our hands, but apparently not. I barely know Chris, I talk to him maybe 10 minutes every ECC and maybe 1-2 times every break tournament. I don't have his contact info, and I don't have an established relationship with him. I'm not trying to be a dick at all here, but think of it this way: Since both Josh and I have no established relationship with him, and since you Rob and Phi do, why don't you guys just let him know that Josh and myself will be directing the tournament this year, but that you guys will be helping (or at least backing us up to do so?)? That way, he'll feel more at ease than just thinking that two nobodies are taking over ECC and are going to run it into the ground.  As for the \u201cmore console than ever\u201d issue, I think the problem here is miscommunication. The $10 entrance fee, Josh and I both assumed, goes to the Break as rental space for all the console tournaments. In previous years, I actually did attempt to find out what happens to the entrace fee at tournaments, and every single time I attempted to find this out, I was met with resistance, as if it were some super-secret conspiracy. Josh and I plan to make ZERO dollars on ECC, in fact, with all the travel time, time off of work, equipment we're lending, food we'll be eating, hotel rooms, etc., we plan to lose a LOT of money on the venture. So get any notion that we're pocketing funds out of your minds, because that is 100% wrong.  Here is the bottom line: between having the Break packed all weekend long with players on all cabs, and having his grill pretty much going all weekend with his really tasty breaksteaks, Chris is going to make a buttload of money regardless of if games are on console or cabinet. Sure, 3s may be on console, but I guarantee you people will be playing on the 3s cabs the entire weekend to get practice in. MvC2 will be packed all weekend as well, as will CvS2. The only games I foresee not being played are the broken CPS1s that never get play anywayalso, I'll be running Alpha 2 and Alpha 3, so that's more additional revenue for Chris since it will be pay-for-play. Let's say that 125 players show up for ECC - that's $1250 plus all money for casuals, and pay-for-play for ST and MvC2 which should be damned close to $750 or more, PLUS all the money he'll make on the grill all weekend which is going to be a ridiculous amount as well. If he's going to argue that he's not making as much as if there were no ECC this year, he is just wrong. I guarantee that having ECC, even mostly on console as it will be this year, is going to make a buttload more money than having his usual 20 DDR players there and the rest being totally empty. Again, I'm not trying to be a jerk, I'm just being realistic, and if you think that Chris will complain that we took 3s off cabs and onto console, then somebody needs to explain to him how much money he's making off ECC regardless of the one-game switch.  Now as for your comment that we're not fronting anything, here is the problem: I have said time and time again that I am willing to donate my time, equipment, and talents to helping the community, but the one thing I really do not have is money. If you're asking me to front $1000 to rent Tekken DR cabs, transport them to the Break (which will cost more than renting them), and then shell out another couple hundred bucks to buy controls for the cabs we will be playing on, the answer is I can't. I am not rich by any means, I don't live with my parents, I have a bajillion bills to pay and I simply don't have the funds to do so. Trust me, if I ever got a decent paying job or I hit the lotto, the first thing I would do is run the most crazy series of pimped-out SF tournaments ever. But I just can't do it. Now if you are suggesting we front money but then take it out of the entry fees later, that's also unacceptable. That would be like gambling: Gee, I hope that we get 150 players so we can actually pay our $1500 bill that we wracked up getting equipment here! Pair that with the fact that I don't have $1500 available in funds to front in the first place! I live day-to-day and as scary as that sounds, that's life in America if you don't live with your parents and can't find a decent job.  The argument about renting Tekken DR cabinets is ridiculous and it's not going to happen. Even if we go out of our way to locate the few people in NJ who own the cabs, now we have to negotiate to rent the cabs for the weekend, find a way to transport them to-from the break (which will be costly and time consuming, even if we just rent a fucking U-Haul truck) and then we're responsible for moving them around, making space, getting them working, and then replacing the DR controlswhich are different from every other American fighting game machine, ever. RIDICULOUSLY UNREASONABLE! I would have to take time off of work starting fucking Wednesday to start picking up these cabs, and then not go back until the next Wednesday to have enough time to clean up and drop them off. Get the fuck out of here! I really do feel bad, but Namco has buttfucked their own US gaming scene by not making DR for PS2 just so the ever-greedy Sony can sell PSPs. I think it's assinine, but getting enough DR cabs to run a proper tournament at the Break is just not going to happen - just look at Ranma's post about how it will take us at LEAST 8-12 hours to run this thing, and that's hoping controls don't break, and you will see why.      Now, if we DO need new sticks for games like MvC2 and such, I might be able to front a couple hundred bucks for those, because that's not a ridiculous amount of money. If we need this Ronny guy to install them, I would suggest the best time is opening time for the Break that Friday, since there will be no MvC2 singles tourney that day and will give at least a day to get the sticks broken in. Again, I won't be able to take a freaking week off of work for this, so it will have to be done Friday morning, and if people don't like the sticks, well that's just the peril of playing on arcade cabs with shitty 360s. 360s are the fucking bane of fighting game players but besides a few people who were around before they were so prominent, nobody wants to admit it. SWITCH STICKS ARE 300% BETTER THAN 360s and if people would just get it through their heads, we would have so many better tournamentsoh well.      I have not been able to get sponsorship because, as I've already said, it's pretty much impossible when you're not really running your own tournament. If Josh and I were taking 100% possession of ECC and were running it at a location we chose, then I would have no problem getting sponsors, and I guarantee you that I would be able to have gotten sponsors 6 months ago. But basically being \u201clocked\u201d into the break because, as Phi put it, \u201cECC is, was, and always will be run at the Break, because Chris Cotty has put so much into it, it is really HIS tournament\u201d and then being told that we're just \u201ca team that Phi has put together to run ECC\u201d is kind of counter-productive. Let's be honest: Capcom of America no longer exists, Namco doesn't sponsor local nobody tournaments, has anybody even heard from Sammy? The only hope would be to possibly get some sponsorship from game control makers like Nubytech or Hori, or maybe Bawls since we all drink so much of it. But again, there is miscommunication: nobody has come to me and said HEY PHIL! Last year we got sponsorship from Bawls and they donated $500 bucks for controls, it was great! All I've been told is that Nubytech donated a few of their HORRIBLE joysticks for the tournament last year for Anniversary Edition, which is so ridiculously laughable, I left my \u201cprize\u201d behind at the break after winning that tournament.  Rob, if you have been in talks with Hori about sponsorship and getting some free stuff for the tournament, PLEASE let me or Josh know about it so we can pick up where you left off. Having a few extra Hori sticks around is going to be VERY beneficial if somebody's stuff breaks down, or if someone doesn't have their own stick. Besides that, unless we can get some kind of monetary sponsorship from one of these companies, I really dont' see how getting a \u201csack o' junk\u201d (forgive the figure of speech) is going to help us run ECC.  I hope that this post clears up some of the issues that have been addressed here, and ultimately helps us make ECC a better tournament.  EDIT: Just to let everyone know, my \u201cR.I.P.

Todd was actually very against adding Tekken to the lineup of ECC for a very long time, although I can't say it's 100% because of time issues. But that's why we're having these issues with Guilty Gear. Hey, again, if Guilty Gear could be played on US PS2s these issues wouldn't even existbut I don't want to be totally swapping PS2s and tvs and stations and shit in the middle of a tournament for the dumb reason that we need modded equipment. I want smooth transition between games and tournaments and MAXIMUM SPACE and time. That can't happen if I shove all console games into 2 days.  Tekken DR is not going to happen in any way, shape or form. So if that's that, and nobody is going to come for Tekken 5, we may as well cancel. This might be dumb but I'll create a poll and see what we come up with. If we do cancel Tekken 5, that gives us a LOT of leeway time-wise, since undoubtedly Tekken would have taken a lot of time Sundaythat would actually work well, since we could do all CvS2, then lots of 3s Saturday, finish 3s first thing Sunday, then final 16 for both tournaments Sunday night.

At that time, we will convert all console stations over to 3s, which we will play for about another 4-6 hours until 12am, and then we will shut down ECC for the night, and continue 3s the next day.

And people wonder why I have issues with that gaming community  Slash WILL take place, it's currently scheduled for Sunday afternoon. I haven't been able to see what people have been saying on Guilty Gear message boards because James had me banned. However, at least two people told me they are bringing their modded PS2s to play Slash, in addition to what Chaz is bringing, so we should definitely be good here.  Also, since it seems like there might be a demand for team tournaments now, I will definitely consider it. IF these take place, it will either be Saturday night, or during the day on Sunday. The only reason I can't set it in stone right now is because we have to see how long it takes to get through CvS2/3s singles on Saturday, and depending on that we will begin to take registrations for team tournaments.  Possible team tournaments are: -CvS2 3-on-3 -3s 3-on-3 -ST 3-on-3 OR random teams drawn out of a hat (to prevent ridiculousness like Team God a few years back)  If we can get 8 teams for any of these tournaments, I will definitely hold them.

{"text": "<YCR>: Yes, but when it comes to ECC this year, he is not selfless at all. First he posted in here shitting on Wigfall and I, asking us if we even cared about ECC, when it's an obvious answer that we do and it's an insult to be asking something like that.  Then he followed me onto the Tekken Zaibatsu forums after I had explained to the Tekken community that we could not hold a full-scale DR tournament at ECC (and even outlined the cost to rent/ship another cabinet to the Break and why it was unreasonable), and instead of backing us up, decided to shit on us again, basically saying we should find DR boards and superguns and somehow learn how to hook them up. He basically said we didn't care about Tekken either and it was our incompetence that led to the problem with Tekken at ECC. This was all AFTER I had already explained to the Tekken community that it is unreasonable to expect Wigfall and I to find Tekken DR boards, rent them, pick them up, hook them up some special way, etc., all for ONE game at ECC. That is just a ridiculous demand for one game, and even EVO isn't having DR this year, so there is no issue up for debate. However, Rob, decided to basically make it look like we didn't care about Tekken, which is NOT true. It was only after Jinmaster decided to selfishly run an Tekken DR tournament the same weekend as ECC that we said screw this, Tekken is cancelled, let Jinmaster take the blame for separating the community because he's a selfish pig.  Now, every time I turn around we have Rob trying to find tiny mistakes to make me look bad. OH MY GOD, it was only the past two EVOs NOT the past three that used PS2 versions of CvS2OH MY GOD ECC used DC one year not PS2who cares?  Now he's on here basically shitting on me again, saying that Guilty Gear Slash is going to suck because of some drama that went on over 3 months ago, even trying to spread rumors that Slash is cancelled because of what some idiot on IRC said. WRONG. I already talked to someone in the Guilty Gear community who has been all over the Guilty Gear message boards, who said that they view Slash as being in the hands of Chaz, so LOTS of people are coming. In fact, a LOT of gamers are going to the Ohio tournament on Saturday, then flying into Jersey for the Slash tournament on Sunday of ECC, according to my sources.  The ONLY person who is saying Slash is cancelled at ECC is James Austin, a.k.a. the person I had to ban from ECC for HIS OWN GOOD because of the ridiculous things he said (and KEPT saying after being warned). I'm afraid if we let him go, he would actually be in danger for \u201ccrossing the line\u201d perhaps not from Wigfall and myself, but from someone else without as much self control. It is just the smart thing to do, I do not want to tarnish the legacy of ECC by having somebody beat the crap out of James because of dumb shit he said here on IRC. James is in #capcom as rabiteluv and he has been trying to talk shit about ECC and basically make it seem like it sucksbut from Guilty Gear players I know, it's not working, and nobody in the community gives a shit that he's banned from ECC besides himself.  I honestly have no idea WHY Rob Sigley is out to make me look bad. I never did a fucking thing to him, until he decided to come in this thread and shit on Wigfall and myself (and don't even try to say he didn't, it's pretty much in black and white, when somebody asks you \u201cif you care about ECC\u201d and you're running the fucking tournament). Don't worry Rob, the legacy of ECC will not be ruined because of things I said. If ECC DOES fail in any respect, the only thing I can foresee is      because there is no Tekken (which is out of our control, Jinmaster did this of his own will and we are not willing to spend thousands of dollars to have multiple DR cabs at ECC, and obviously no other major tournament is either, so SUE ME)      because there MIGHT not be as good of a turnout for Guilty Gear Slash as we'd like. NOT because of the comments I said MONTHS ago which most people don't even fucking remember, but because James Austin is on a mission to make ECC look bad through IRC and Guilty Gear message boards, because he said some of the dumbest shit ever on SRK and now doesn't want to face the consequences of his own actions.  The ONLY reason I can think that Rob Sigley is so pissed at me is because, at previous Phi-run tournaments including ECC, he's been his \u201cright hand man,\u201d pretty much running CvS2 and other side events. That's great, but guess what, ECC is not run by Phi this year and we don't need your help. Seriously. I'm sorry you're taking it in such a bad way and you think you're experienced and a professionaland Phi has addressed me as being \u201cunprofessional\u201dbut let's get serious: THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL THING YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO SHIT ON THE NEW STAFF OF ECC AT EVERY FUCKING SECOND, ACROSS DIFFERENT WEBSITE MESSAGE BOARDS.

{"text": "<YCR>: The only reason there was drama between myself and Guilty Gear players was because, months ago, I posted that I was thinking of doing Guilty Gear Reload, and there was a MASSIVE backlash in my face. Everybody was basically saying \u201cSlash or nothing\u201d and I basically complied and said we will either have slash, or NOTHING. At that point, Slash hadn't even been released for Japanese PS2 (and there wasn't even a set release date) so we had no idea if it would be available for ECC or not. It was pretty much the same situation as Tekken DR ended up in - at that point, it looked like we would have had to go through a ridiculous amount of trouble to get enough supplies together to run a full-scale Slash tournament. In fact, to be totally honest it is STILL up in the air whether or not we will have enough Japanese PS2s/copies of Slash to run a good tournament, because we are depending pretty much 100% on donated Japanese/modded PS2s and copies of the game. If the Guilty Gear community does not bring these pieces of equipment, there will not be a Slash tournament. I don't know about you, but as the director of a major tournament, I don't like completely depending on others, but I hope it does work out.  Oh, by the way, having Slash on Sunday WILL cut into the schedule exactly as I've said all along, and if things get delayed (including top 16 of CvS2 and top 16 of 3s) I'm simply going to have nothing to say but \u201cthe Guilty Gear players demanded they have their tournament on the weekend.\u201d As it is, Friday is pretty much WIDE OPEN because nobody wanted to have their tournament then. It's funny that for EVO everybody can make it out for three days, but when it comes to ECC all we get is whining and complaining. I'm sorry, but this IS a dedication issue.  Phi never had a problem with ANYTHING. Phi would try to have every possible game on the planet at ECC, and that has both good and bad side effects. It's great to involve everyone possible, but at the same time, you have to be realistic: the Break is not growing every year, it is the same small, cramped location that ECC has always been held at. We have outright been told by Phi that ECC is NOT allowed to move because the ECC name basically started at the Break and out of respect it will always be held at the Break. Given this limitation, it is pretty unreasonable that we should decide to include every single game at ECC every single year. NO MATTER WHAT, NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAYS, IT WILL BE THE \u201cBIG FOUR\u201d CAPCOM GAMES THAT GET PRIORITY OVER ALL ELSE AT ECC. It was always Capcom fighters that kept ECC alive (and was the reason ECC began) so to not give priority to those tournaments would be insane. I've been around the SF community since 1991 and I live and bleed these games, and I'm not going to short-change the players that have been around since the 1990s and have kept this community alive, for newer games, under ANY circumstances. I absolutely DON'T want people playing after midnight, and I DON'T want tournaments going until 8am, which HAS happened in the past at ECC.  The fact of the matter is, you can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all of the people some of the time, but you CANNOT please all of the people all of the time. As much as we would love to have every single fighting game present at ECC, and have them all at the times that everyone wants them in, and be able to ship in DR cabs and yadda yadda yaddawe do not have the money, time, or space to do so. This year we went with a lot of difficult decisions:  -Putting 3s on console instead of arcade cabinet, because in past years, LOTS of players have complained that the cabinets at the break are too cramped to play and the controls are sub-par -Putting switch sticks into ST because most old-school players hate perfect 360s for that game -NOT having a full-scale Tekken DR tournament because it would be ridiculously costly and time consuming -NOT having Tekken 5 after Jinmaster announced his tournament in Philly the same weekend of ECC -Moving Slash around into different time slots until it was finally decided to be run on Sunday -Predicting that Dead or Alive 4 would be worthy of a tournament after low turnout at Texas Showdown and a non-existant tournament at Final Round (thanks toguess who?..JINMASTER!). Apparently this is working out, because people on the Dead or Alive forums seem excited, especially now that DOA4 is announced for EVO.  It's EASY to sit on the sidelines and criticise, and say that we did this wrong and we went the wrong way there, but try being in the shoes of Wigfall and myself, trying to please hundreds of gamers while not screwing over any particular audience. Throw in the fact that we weren't even sure that Chris Cotty would approve of everything until a few weeks ago, and the fact that we had TWO completely new games coming out that everybody wanted to play (Slash and DR) and you'll realize that it's a lot more complicated than just saying \u201cyes\u201d to everyone and giving everyone what they wanted. To be COMPLETELY honest, if it weren't for Tekken being cancelled, I still have no idea how Slash would have been able to be run on Sunday and not delay all of the finals of the other, major tournaments.  I'm sure Todd and Phi have faced this kind of criticism before as well, so it's no news to me. I remember the days of reading Todd's rants (even listening to the audio rant after an ECC when people accused the East Coast players of throwing ice at Ricky Ortiz, and Todd had to defend himself) and this kind of thing is nothing new at all. The fact of the matter is, when Phi announced he was not going to run ECC anymore, it was Wigfall and I that stepped upnot Rob Sigley, not anybody in the Guilty Gear or Tekken communities. We volunteered to do this and we were fully prepared to take on all the work, and the criticism, that goes with it. Hey, I even got the added bonus of getting fired for no reason whatsoever! But that's besides the point.  The fact is, we are working to make ECC the absolute best tournament it can be. We're confident that the changes we've made this year WILL make ECC a better tournament overall for the people who attend. When else have you ever been to a touranment that had polls asking what kind of controls you wanted, what version of a game you wanted to play, and then actually ACTED off of those results? Next year, if ECC totally flops THIS year, somebody else can step up and take control of ECC, whether it be Phi or Rob Sigley or whoever. But I guarantee that this year ECC will NOT flop, in fact it will be a huge success, with not only the highest-quality MvC2 tournament, but the only ST tournament with switch-stick controls, a quality 3s tournament with the controls everyone CHOOSES to play on, and FINALLY a CvS2 tournament with MULTIPLE STATIONS at ECCno more ONE cabinet schenanigans. Throw in the only official DOA4 tournament to be held pre-EVO on the East Coast, and a Slash tournament held on the day the players demanded it, and you've got a winning combination. Oh, and don't worry, I know how to draw up brackets :rofl:  Do not worry, ECC is in good hands, and it will be just as good, if not BETTER, than previous years, in 2006.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: You realize that everything you've quoted can be taken in a different light, right?  \u201cOriginally Posted by DarksydePhil: Guilty Gear entries really don't matter to me in the least. I don't know if you remember, but I was actually staunchly against even running Guilty Gear this year. It gets the least number of entries a lot of the time, it takes up lots of consoles and space.\u201d  CORRECT. I personally don't care about Guilty Gear, but if you didn't know, I'm also not running every single tournament at ECC. Josh appointed Chaz to run Guilty Gear, so regardless of if I like the game or not, there is someone there who plays it and will be handling it professionally. Guilty Gear DOES take up a LOT of resources (we have to swap out normal PS2s for modded/Japanese ones and get imported copies of the game) and it's going to be a big hassle to hope that we have enough stuff to run it correctly. Right now, we have TWO modded PS2s guaranteed to be there, and that's IT. Only one person came to me and offered to donate their modded PS2, and Chaz is bringing his, so unless we get several more, that is all the Slash players will have to play on. In addition, think of the hassle we're going to have Sunday when Guilty Gear Slash ends, and most of the Guilty Gear players want to go home (since they probably wont' stick around for 3s or CvS2 top 16). Now, we have to swap out those modded PS2s with different ones, probably swap TVs around, etcit's a pain in the ass. IF Slash had been held on Friday, Guilty Gear players would have had free usage of ALL the console area in the arcade. Now, they are basically going to use it for a few hours Sunday morning and then I predict a big group of gamers leaving, and leaving Josh and I with a lot of setup work to get the top 16 in CvS2/3s going.  \u201cOriginally Posted by DarksydePhill: However, after I proposed not having Guilty Gear, every fucking whiny player on the planet flamed me saying that I was being biased.\u201d  TRUE. I PROPOSED not having Guilty Gear, because when I asked the community what version of the game should be played, it started a HUGE argument about Reload vs. Slash. A lot of people didn't want Slash because it was so new, and it wasn't even guaranteed it would have been released in time for ECC (remember, this was said MONTHS ago). So I basically said that the Guilty Gear community would have to decide or else we might not have any GG present at ECC. And what happened? I had to suffer a ridiculous backlash of insults, basically saying I'm the next Hitler for saying such a thing, and that GG is a staple of ECC and blah blah blah.  \" Originally Posted by j1n**: I drove 10 hours last year and even helped, they used 2 of our PS2's IIRC, the Tournament Ran smoothly I felt. Phi and Sigley said thanks too, it was a fun time.\"  A perfect example of somebody willing to donate for their community. This is great and nobody is saying anything bad about this person. Funny, though, that as soon as my comments were taken out of context, he decided to run the Ohio Guilty Gear tournament just to spite ECC. Sorry, I personally dont' love GG, but Chaz does and he's willing to run a kick-ass Slash tournament despite all the shittalk people are spreading, saying we're NOT running it at ECC. In fact, Chaz is flying to Ohio and then flying back here the next day to run Slash, according to rumorthat's fucking CRAZY dedication.  Also, don't try to lecture me on how you drove to ECC and gave two PS2s. You don't want to know the thousands upon thousands of dollars of equipment I'm bringing to ECC this year  \u201cUm, the GG community always comes through with the equipment, I don't think anyone's worried about the lack of equipment come Sunday of ECC.\u201d  That's all well and good, but as I have said, so far NOBODY besides one person (and Chaz) has said they are bringing modded PS2s and copies of Slash. It's great to say that something ALWAYS happens, but being one of the two people primarily in charge of ECC, I'd love to have ALL supplies set in stone at this point. Having absolutely no idea who is bringing what and how many Slash setups will be there worries me, because not only does it have the probability to screw the Guilty Gear players that do show up at ECC, but it also has the potential to screw everyone else, because now those 2-3 Slash stations are going to be taken ALL DAY since it will take so long to run the tournament.  Everyone needs to get overthemselves here. People love to take things I say and twist them and exaggerate, and take them out of context, to make me look like the devil. All I've tried to do all along is make a fair and balanced tournament for everyone. Selfish people (Jinmaster) and people with no self control (James Austin) have thrown kinks into the chain that is ECC, but it will still roll along strong regardless. If everyone can forget about the fucking spite of everything and just get over themselves, maybe we can work together to get something done.  Right NOW, here are the things we still need for ECC:  -At LEAST two modded PS2 consoles -2 or more copies of GG Slash -At LEAST one more TV of 19\" or larger (this is our most DIRE NEED to have the full 8 console stations available, if you can bring one please PM or post here ASAP)  If players from the Guilty Gear community are coming, they should post or PM me IMMEDIATELY and say they are donating their equipment, so that I can 1. figure out if we'll have enough and 2. reserve them free entry into the tournament.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}

{"text": "<YCR>: First, ECC ends sunday so there will definitely not be any casuals on Monday.  WHEN casuals wil be depends on how long it takes for tournaments to end  For example, on Saturday CvS2 starts at 1pm and when that reaches top 16, we will get to 3s. After THAT is done we will consider either casuals or running CvS2/3s teams if there is enough demand.  On Sunday we will have a pretty full schedule of Slash, CvS2/3s top 16, but after that ends we'll also have an opportunity for casuals. It all depends on a few factors:      How many people actually pre-register and register on Friday on-site, letting us create brackets ahead of time so we can save time on Saturday.     How many people actually LISTEN TO US and stick around for their pools playing on Saturday, avoiding delays. I WILL disqualify anybody not there for their pool after 10 minutes, so tough shit to those who vanish and don't let me know ahead of time.     How many console stations we actually end up with. So far there are six guaranteed, but we are depending on people for donated PS2s, copies of games, and TVs. If Several people flake, it may take longer than usual.  So, to be honest, I can't guarantee any specific time for casuals on Saturday/Sunday. All I can really say is, if you are staying at the Motel 6 down the street, LOTS of people stay up all night playing games, and you will definitely get some casuals in.  Also Master Chibi: It all depends on what happens with Chris Cotty. IF he lets us keep stuff at the arcade, then yes, I will take your TV on Friday and be able to hold it until we're done on Sunday. However, if he DOESN'T want any stuff left at his arcade, my car will be jam-packed and will have no room to transport another TVso you will have to hold it until Saturday.

{"text": "<YCR>: ONLY TEN DAYS LEFT UNTIL ECC!  So far, everything is coming together nicely. We should have EIGHT console stations available, four MvC2 cabinets, and two Super Turbo cabs. ALL cabinets will have fully new controls, including all buttons, switches and joysticks. We are going to have a tech do this for us Friday morning so that we will have Friday night to break everything in (during Marvel teams for example) and in working shape for Saturday-Sunday.  So far, not many people have pre-registered, but this is understandable since I'm assuming a lot of people want to be 100% sure they're coming, and what they're entering. REMEMBER, PRE-REGISTRATION CLOSES AT MIDNIGHT ON THURSDAY MAY 25TH. If you do not register by that time, then you will have to show up on Friday to get the $10 cover charge discount. IF NOT, you WILL be paying a $15 cover charge fee for late entry on Saturday-Sunday. NO EXCUSES. All entries are NON-REFUNDABLE.  I'm pretty pumped, and I know a hell of a lot of other people are.

In previous years, compromises had to be made when there weren't enough stations, but this year we will have more than enough PS2s and TVs to accomodate this.  Also, I posted an apology to the Guilty Gear community over in that Ohio tournament thread, and I want to post one here too.  I want to apologize to the Guilty Gear community for anything that I may have said to disrespect them. Although I may not like or play GG myself, it is still a community of gamers that deserves respect, and the game definitely deserves a spot at ECC.  I know that certain other parties have used the misquotations of things I said, out of context, to hype up their own events running parallel to ECC. Not only is this disrespectful to myself (who cares), but to the entire gaming community. All these people have succeeded in doing is exploiting misinformation to promote their own events and \u201chype up\u201d their own reputationspretty selfish. In addition, they've succeeded in dividing the community even further than before. Ever wonder why the majority of Fighting game tournaments can't get sponsorship? Ever wonder why there's no \u201ctournament league\u201d for any fighting games? This is why.  Instead of taking the time to talk to myself or Josh Wigfall about the GG situation at ECC, certain parties took it into their own hands to try to slander ECC on other message boards, and right now they're taking part in a word-of-mouth campaign to say that there isn't even any Guilty Gear at ECC. When I tried to reach out to the parties who are running this tournament, I was BANNED from the Guilty Gear message board, and I was never contacted to discuss the issue although I had requested it. This is pure BULLSHIT, and not the way to go about things.  We cared so much about GG, we ended up moving the tournament from Friday (which was originally planned) to Sunday (which was requested by GG players), we recruited CHAZ (a GG player) to run it, and now we are in the process of securing multiple console stations for you to play on.  People have accused me of being unprofessional when it comes to Guilty Gear. I do want to apologize to anyone who feels this way. Maybe some of the things I said about GG were out of line, but at the same time, they ring true: time WILL be limited, it WOULD have been easier/better to have Slash on Friday, and I really DON'T care about GG myself personally (that's why we recruited Chaz and I'm not running it!). But regardless of how I feel, growing up with SF and respecting that series of games, it's not reason for anyone to boycott ECC, which is arguably the longest-running and BEST fighting video game major in the COUNTRY.  I hope that this will help to clear the air between myself and the GG community. I also hope to see lots of you on the Sunday of ECC. And, I also hope that those of you who are planning to go to the Ohio event on Saturday, and THEN fly/drive to Jersey for Slash on Sunday of ECC, are successful and have no problems.

Gee, that's funny, because we WERE going to throw a huge Tekken 5.0 tournament at ECC, until Jinmaster decided to run a Tekken DR/SC3 tournament in Philly at the same time.  So, while you all could have been in New Jersey practicing for a game with over $8k in prizes in less than three months, against hundreds of players, you'll either be sitting at home doing nothing, or you'll be in Philly, playing against a handful of players, in a game that has no competitive future due to cost and availability issues. It doesn't make any difference how GOOD a game is, if it's too expensive to get and there's no console release, it will not be played. Compare a game like Unreal Tournament 2004 to Halo 2a FAR superior FPS, but a much MUCH smaller competitive audience, since Halo 2 can pretty much be played by anybody for about 200 bucks, while you need an expensive computer to run Unreal.

Or if you want to be able to switch mid-tournament, post. The message here is, POST!  As for the Tekken issue  Let me clarify my statements so nobody can take them the wrong way (wouldn't be the first time).  First of all, the statements I made do NOT apply to all Tekken players. I know there is a group of you who support ECC and wanted to come and play, and are furious that 1. Namco won't give you a PS2 port of DR and 2. Jinmaster is selfish and did what he did. Remember, I WANTED to have a smaller, capped DR tournament and a full scale Tekken 5.0 tournament on console. I have NOTHING against the Tekken community as a whole.  Now, who I DO have issues with are obviously 1. Jinmaster and 2. the bunch of Tekken players who came on here and also on Tekken Zaibatsu, slamming ECC. The gist of their comments? \u201cChris Cotty is a rich guy who won't rent us DR cabs for ECC, the Break sucks, Dunellen sucks, ECC sucks, the staff of ECC sucks.\u201d These players then went on to follow Jinmaster and his proposed tournament in Philly and continued to slam ECC. But now that it's been announced that EVO is Tekken 5.0, they must be feeling REALLY stupid.  Now my point isn't to rub salt in wounds, but to basically just give those people a WAKE UP CALL. Hopefully next time, you will not listen to Jinmaster. PLEASE learn from what's happened and actually listen to those who are trying to incorporate Tekken into the fighting game community, such as the staff of ECC and EVO. WE ARE TRYING TO HELP, but it's Namco's fault there is no PS2 port of DR. I wish to god there was, because I would probably be playing it myself if there was! and there definitely wouldnt' be any of this needless drama over Tekken.  I want to APOLOGIZE to anybody who thought I was basically trying to diss the entire Tekken community, because I'm not. I said it incorrectly, I only meant to address those that, for some reason, are trying to pull Tekken away from the fighting game majors, AGAIN. This has happened before and only in the past few years, through the incorporation of multiple Tekken games at EVO and also at ECC, that Tekken has been pulled into the general fighting game audience. I have no idea WHY the Tekken community would want to pull away from this support and go do their own thingI mean, is Tekken 5.0 REALLY such a bad game? Were people saying that before DR came out?

Many notable players from the NYC area, along with most of the West Coast players who are coming to ECC, will be there to break in the controls on the MvC2 cabinets (and if anyone is interested in some ST casuals, I'll be sure to hand you your butts in that too!). There is also the possibility of having some CvS2 or 3s warm-up tournaments, but we need to run that by Chris Cotty first, which we will be doing today. SO, if you are free on Thursday night and will be in the area, stop by the Break for some great Pre-ECC Fun.  NOTE: If you are unable to attend ECC on Friday and want to pre-register and only pay the $10 cover charge, rather than waiting until Saturday and being forced to pay the $15, I will be willing to take registrations Thursday night.  ** -HUGE UPDATE: There WILL be MvC2 teams on Friday night. There will also be CvS2 teams on Friday night, as well as 3s teams (if enough people are ready for it) AS LONG AS it is OK with Chris Cotty to set up the console equipment and leave it there overnight.** Since we are going to have so many console stations (8) it will be ridiculous for us to be moving TVs and consoles in/out of the Break every dayif this is what we are forced to do, we will only be setting up consoles on Saturday/Sunday and so the CvS2 and 3s team tournaments will be pushed back until Saturday night. Hopefully that will not be the case! By the way, it has been decided that for both CvS2 and 3s teams, each team will have THREE players, not just two. Also, for CvS2 each player WILL be allowed to pick and entire team of fighters, not just one character forming one team only.  We will be taking all registrations for team tournaments on-site so no need to worry about pre-registering for those.

{"text": "<YCR>: Answers:  For hotels, the traditional thing everybody does is stay at Motel 6 for a few reasons. First, it's cheap, and most gamers are looking for the most economical thing to do. Splitting a room here for a few days won't cost you much at all. Second, EVERYBODY who attends ECC usually stays at Motel 6 because they are really good about noiseI think out of all the years we've ever stayed there, there's only been one complaint about noise ever, and it was by a couple of retarded guests. Usually gamers can \u201ctake over\u201d the hotel, which basically means it's really easy to move from room to room for casuals. Hell, for a few years Scott from CT brought a red Bronco truck and actually had a hookup for Marvel and other games OUTSIDE the hotel in the parking lot all night long.  If you're looking for other hotels, for example one with internet, the Holiday Inn across the street is a little bit more expensive (I think about $20 more a night) but the rooms are a lot bigger and nicer. It really depends on 1. how much money you're willing to spend and 2. if you want to be where all the other gamers are, so you can easily go from room to room for casuals.  As for DVDs, right now there is no plan for any release. Too much cost (and obviously problems with places like the one EVO uses) to invest in right now. Preppy will be in attendance and no doubt getting the majority of good MvC2 footage. I will also be bringing my camcorder to record notable matches/finals for all tournaments, and also to get some interviews for the HATER CAM. We ARE allowing footage to be taped, so if you want to record for yourself, it's not a problem at all. More than likely, what will end up happening is Zach will release all the good MvC2 footage, and then I'll encode the videos for all other games and find somebody to host them.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: ALL INFO ON CvS2/3s TEAMS CAN BE FOUND BELOW:   Formats/Rules: teams of 3. Depending on turnout, either round robin or double elim. For CvS2, each player on a team is allowed to play a FULL game, not just play 1 character. You ARE required to pick the same team/character throughout the entire tournament, so think STRATEGICALLY and build your teams around that idea. You will be required to tell me what your team/character selection is before the tournament starts. Also, no 2 players on the same team can pick the same EXACT character/team. Just like being in Japan!  So for example: If I'm in CvS2 teams I will pick C-groove Vega, Blanka, Sagat. My teammate then CANNOT pick that same combination of groove and characters. HOWEVER, he may pick the same 3 characters IF HE CHANGES HIS GROOVE. So the second player on the team CAN pick K-groove Vega, Blanka, Sagat. Be sure to pick wisely, because you MUST play that team throughout the entire tournament.  For 3s, each player MUST select a different character. You must play that character throughout the entire tournament.  Entry: $5/head  That's the final word!", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: EXTREMELY IMPORTANT UPDATE: Josh Wigfall just returned from a trip to the Break to discuss things with Chris Cotty.  The most important thing we learned is that the Dunellen police are REALLY cracking down on people loitering/hanging out in front of 8 on the Break. In fact, they complained to Chris Cotty this past weekend and made it VERY clear to him that if there is anyone in front of the Break, they will CLOSE THE ARCADE AND END ECC.  SO, what can we do? We know ECC can be really hot and smelly at times being inside the Break all day. Well, we offer a few solutions:      Hang out BEHIND the arcade when you have to     Chris is going to set up some tables/chairs in the back of the Break for people to hang out and sit down, so you don't have to sit out front to cool off     I will be bringing SEVERAL air-freshening items to keep the Break smelling good     Since everything will be run on the pool system, you will be able to LEAVE when it's not your time to play (yay!) and COME BACK when you have to play again!  LET IT BE KNOWN RIGHT NOW THAT IF YOU ARE FOUND LOITERING OUTSIDE THE FRONT OF THE BREAK AT ANY POINT DURING ECC WEEKEND, WE WILL DISQUALIFY YOU. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. ECC WILL LITERALLY BE SHUT DOWN IF DUNELLEN POLICE FIND PEOPLE HANGING OUTSIDE THE FRONT OF THE BREAK, SO WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS!  Okay, now that that is out of the way Please see below for the FINAL (really this time!) schedule for ECC! Now including final plans for all team tournaments!

No consoles allowed until Saturday.  Friday, May 26th -This is the first official registration day. Save $5 by registering on-site today. I will probably show up at the arcade in the afternoon around 3-4pm to start taking registrations, but the official time to show up is between 6-10pm. -MvC2 teams starts at 6pm. -3s and CvS2 will both have at least 1 cabinet each, and we will make sure controls work, so you can play some casuals that night.

{"text": "<YCR>: It was \u201cthe LEGEND\u201d aka Phi that told Josh and I that under no circumstances would ECC ever be moved from the Break. Moving was actually one of the first ideas we tossed aroundI was considering moving it to Rhode Island or Mass. and possibly teaming up with Andy to get something going. But then we were told that ECC started at the Break and is closely intertwined with Chris Cotty, and if any tournament was going to be run and still called \u201cEast Coast Championships\u201d it would HAVE to be held at the Break.  Now don't get me wrong, I have no problem with Chris Cotty or running ECC at the Break, but I definitely understand your concerns. What I will say is this: I will be keeping an eye on what is going on outside the Break at all times, and if I see anybody out there they will get 1 chance, and that's it.** I WILL NOT HAVE ECC SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF PEOPLE WHO CANNOT READ OR LISTEN.** I will also be telling every single person that registers in person, that they cannot stand outside the front of the Break, just in case they don't read the SRK forums or don't remember.  Its definitely tough. I would love to get something different going, something similar to Final Round or Texas Showdown, or even EVO, next year. But ECC is a name that will not dieit is now the longest-running traditional competitive fighting game tournament in the USA (name another tournament with ELEVEN installments, and that's not even counting the 3.5 or whatever Todd ran that one random year). There is definitely a legacy there that is hard to let go.  At the same time, ECC and the Street Fighter community have now grown, grown so much that it is very possible that it is now too large for the Break to hold. If it weren't for the cancellation of Tekken events, and the addition of 8 console stations instead of just a handful (and moving CvS2/3s to PS2 consequently), I bet the Break would have been literally bursting at the seams this year, and everything would have run late. As it is, with the time/space we are given by Chris Cotty, we might not even be able to have the Team Tournaments that we really want to run.  However  There ARE things in the works. Depending on how things actually go this year, and on certain factors and things that are already in motion, it is VERY possible that come 2007 there will be a new East Coast major.

{"text": "<YCR>: I have an important announcement  I want it to be known that we will NOT be using the \u201cJudgement\u201d system in 3s to determine a winner, if that does happen.  Instead, in the case of a draw, we will be replaying that one game of that match to determine a winner.  I know that EVO is using Judgement, but I'm not one to just go ahead and start using Japanese criteria to determine a winner, when there is no real way to figure out how that process works. The fact of the matter is, NOBODY has any idea how Judgement really works, so to use it to determine a definitive winner, in a competitive tournament where money is at stake, is INSANE.

{"text": "<YCR>: You're asking the wrong person, I'm in charge of registrations, supplies, posting info on SRK, CvS2/ST/DOA4 singles, and all non-MvC2 team tournaments.  Josh is solely in charge of all MvC2 events and 3s singles, as well as being the direct contact with Chris Cotty, so I honestly have no idea why he's chosing to run it then, you should talk to him about it. I would assume he's doing it then because      That will give the new controls, which will be installed on Thursday, LOTS of time to be broken in;     If the team tournament is the only thing going on Friday besides registration, we can finish up by 10pm and go see X3 if we want;     More people will be at the Break on Saturday, so this event will seem more hyped up with everybody there, rather than a \u201cdamn, I missed the 5 on 5 because I didn't come a day early for ECC\u201d attitude;     and 4. Josh plans on stopping MvC2 once he's gotten the top 32 out of pools, and then resuming on Sunday.

{"text": "<YCR>: Ladies and gentlemen, there have been some startling developments as of late. First, apparently TFGM (or somebody using the nick TFGM) went on IRC a few nights ago and outright THREATENED Desmond \"Xecutioner\" Pinkney.  Des said he wanted to quit the Empire, and TFGM said he had better not OR ELSE! What does that mean? For the full logs, go here: http://www.shoryuken.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=38830  In addition to this, I have some HUGE NEWS from a VERY VERY BELIEVABLE SOURCE (meaning its no bullshit, its TRUE)  that both Josh Wigfall and Desmond Pinkney THREW THEIR MATCHES IN THE MVC2 5v5 EXHIBITION @ EVO.  The word is that after Nestor won the mini-tournament to get on the East Coast 5v5 team, TFGM wanted him OFF because he was not \"in the empire.\" Ricky Ortiz payed off his debt, and TFGM basically THREW Nestor off the team and payed him $50 to be replaced with Ricky.  SO, Josh and Desmond were so pissed off at TFGM thinking he had power like that, they picked teams they don't normally use and knew they would not win with.  The whole thing was a ruse to get TFGM back for kicking the most worthy player off the team.  Apparently Josh and Desmond never liked TFGM that much and are both glad to not be a part of Empire Arcadia.  Current developments have forced me to rethink things a bit. Soon I'm going to be making an announcement that will SHOCK THE STREET FIGHTER WORLD and probably tear the East Coast gaming community apart.

Just what were the two \"incidents\" that almost shut down EVO? There are rumors all over SRK...Pyrolee sent home in an ambulance?  Jaha punked down several people from Arizona?  What's the real deal?  All of this is unconfirmed, of course, but there's so much of it going around it's worth reporting and speculating about.  UPDATE: Here is EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE of a fight that took place at EVO today!!!  Okay, I'd like to take a time-out from the EVO updates for a second to address an issue quickly.  I am banned from Shoryuken.com.  I was banned because I was attempting to provide EVO rumors and info, exactly as you see it on this webpage, early on Thursday.  Preliminary reports stated that there may have been a fight a EVO, so I reported it but stated it was only rumor.  Well, the Cannons saw this, didn't like it, and deleted ALL of my EVO update info, totally wiping out two informative threads on SRK with no explanation or apology.  SO, I posted again in the official SRK results forum Thursday night, this time without the rumors concerning the fight.  I broke the story about Sanford getting arrested and not being at EVO, in addition to updates about casual play and such.  I also was pretty mad about my threads getting deleted so I said in a blanket statement \"whoever deleted my threads is a faggot.\"  I did not know it was one of the cannons (Ponder aka Tony Cannon to be specific) so I was not intending to insult them.  I just thought I deserved an explanation as to why my threads of super-demanded info were deleted...that was a lot of work I went to, to get that info, and at the very least the Cannons could have talked to me and just said \"we don't want stupid rumors about fights on SRK making us look bad.\" But instead, they outright deleted threads with NO explanation, and it pissed me off.  Well, apparently I'm not allowed to be pissed, because I was BANNED from SRK for calling Ponder a faggot.  And I have been banned ever since.  Hence, I have been forced to post all updates HERE on Top-Haters.com rather than on SRK. Of course, I can get on SRK whenever I want because I'm not stupid, but that's not the point. The point is that Ponder banned me for calling him a name, because he deleted my informative threads with no explanation. Give me a break.  All I've been trying to do these past few days is provide a service to you, the Street Fighter community.  I didn't have to spend all of this time going from source to source to compile this info...but I felt that it would be helpful to fellow gamers, and so I've been pretty much glued to my phone and my computer for the past few days.  You know, I may throw jokes around, pranks like the DEVO video, etc., but those that know me know I'm just doing it to be funny and spice up the SF community.  I never meant to DEGRADE or DEGENERATE anything...but then there are people like the Cannons who take things seriously, because they have no sense of humor.  To those of you who have no sense of humor, I say BLAH, and                                                                                                               ......................./\u00b4\u00af)                                                                                                              ....................,/\u00af  /                                                                                                              .................../     /                                                                                                              ............./\u00b4\u00af/'    '/\u00b4\u00af\u00af`\u00b7\u00b8                                                                                                              ........../'/    /    /         /\u00a8\u00af\\                                                                                                              ........('(   \u00b4   \u00b4      \u00af~/'     ')                                                                                                              .........\\        TOP ' /                                                                                                              ..........'\\   HATERS  _.\u00b7\u00b4                                                                                                              ............\\   OWN    (                                                                                                              ..............\\  YOU     .

So, a little info on the underdog.  -Virtual Fighter 4 results: Pool 1 Results 1) Kofu Megane (Aoi, Japan) 2) Myke (Kage, Australia) 3) Shou (Sarah, STL, US) 4) Dave (Shun, STL, US)   Pool 2 Results 1) Ryan Hart (Kage, UK) 2) Nuki (Aoi, Japan) 3) Matsuda (Akira, Japan) 4) Martin (Lion, US)   Pool 3 Results 1) Ohsu Akira (Akira, Japan) 2) Mad Dog Jin (Jacky, Korea) 3) ModestMouse (Lion, LA, US) 4) Tetsuya (Jacky, Japan)   Pool 4 Results 1) Chibita (Lion, Japan) 2) Neo Tower (Jacky, Japan) 3) spotlite (Akira, CA. US) 4) phoenixdth (Lei, CA, US)  -MvC2: Genghis and Amir qualify as well -MvC2 bracket results:  Harry Potter and David Lee from bracket 3, Scott Wong and Clockw0rk from bracket 2 qualify and move on to the next round -Ricky Ortiz has send Japanese player OhNuki to the losers bracket in CvS2! -Apparently everybody is smoking some wicked Cali bud!!!! -Some early results:  3s: Hung beats BAS  MvC2: David Lee beats Harry Potter and Martin Garcia (Mag).  CvS2: Arturo, Sin, Oliver, Trinh Ngyuen, Crowinhtown, Justin Wong.  Apparently all doing well.  -Ricky Ortiz will be taking the place of Sanford Kelly in the EC vs WC 5v5 MvC2 challenge. -Ryan Hart (UK) beat the Korean Tekken Tag Tournament champion (Kim Bon Min?) in their money match 26-21. That's a pretty big upset. -SUPER HUGE UPDATE: EVO brackets at http://www.mistfiner.us/  Not sure if these will be updated live or not... -There are 700+ entrants for EVO this year, more than expected. -The tournaments are now TWO HOURS LATE and have not yet started as of 12pm Pacific time.  More info to come!  Here are the updates for Evolution 2003 for THURSDAY, which was casual play day: -Sanford Kelly will NOT be attending Evolution this year.  He was arrested early Thursday for jumping over a turnstile in a NYC subway without paying the fare.  He was released from jail late Thursday night but already missed his plane.  He has no ID on him; TFGM's wife (TFGM is the head of Empire Arcadia) was holding it for it at the airport so he wouldn't lose it. So even if Sanford got another ticket, he has no way to catch a later flight because he can't prove who he is.  TFGM and the entire Team NYC is FURIOUS with Sanford...Xecutioner told him that \"when we get back, you're done.\"  Whatever that means. SO, who will replace Sanford in the 5v5 West Coast vs East Coast MvC2 challenge? -Casual play wasn't pretty.  In GGXX, the US pretty much got dominated by Japan in all aspects.  Apparently the best US GGXX player Saif, got PERFECTED by Daigo in a casual match. -There was a GGXX team tournament, it was the five best West Coast players against an alliance of the five best players from the East Coast and the Midwest.  The results: WC 22 wins, the Alliance 3.  Ouch. -In Third Strike, Japanese player K.O. dominated all.  Also, OhNuki had a 27+ winstreak and was still going when this news was leaked. -Justin Wong and Mixup have been running a MvC2 casual play cabinet. -There were a lot of casual tournaments including MvC2 and 3s, but it is unclear who exactly entered.", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: I'm going to be succint, and to the point, and end ALL of this discussion about console vs arcade cab, SRK vs the players, good vs evil, blah blah blah. This post will solve the entire issueand still manage to be long.  The Real Issue: What is EVO?  If EVO is indeed a convention-like event where the majority of players are coming to have a lot of casual games, meet other players, and hang out, then console is the obvious correct choice. It saves time, money, and provides the opportunity for a lot of casual play, filling in those awkward spaces of \u201chaving nothing to do\u201d between tournament matches. Since the numbers attending EVO have grown, and the crowd going to EVO is ever-changing, it appears that this may be the correct assumption.  But, if EVO is indeed the biggest, best, most serious Street Fighter tournament in the United States (and in the case of MvC2, the ENTIRE WORLD), then arcade cabinets are the correct choice. The top-players of ALL Street Fighter games are accustomed to this venue, this style of control as well as these versions of the games. Having an all-arcade tournament caters to these top playersthe players that pretty much created the Street Fighter community, popularized it, and turned it into what it is today. The players that were around before the era of multiple thousand-dollar first prizes and thousands of attendees.  So that's the issue: What is EVO? Has it grown into a convention where thousands of fighting gamers can get together and have fun, and a lot of casual play? Or is EVO the biggest, best, most serious and meaningful tournament EVER?  The PROBLEM is this:  Everyone seems to think to call EVO one thing, you have to sacrifice the other. It CAN'T be a convention and a serious tournament all at the same timethis is the general consensus, it seems.  Why is this?  The Cannons have told us thatNO MATTER WHATEvo will be console this year. Because it's for the best interest of EVO and the players attending.  The Cannons are right. Making EVO console will help it to grow, and give the majority of players something to do instead of standing around during tournament matches.  But let's say that Justin Wong, undisputed MvC2 champion, loses at EVO this year, for the first time in 4 years.  Well, because EVO is console, you have just negated the accoplishment of whoever beat Justin, and the significance of the loss. Because Justin has always been accustomed to playing, and winning, on arcade cabinetson that specific style of control and that specific version of the game. You can attempt to emulate it by sticking velcro to his joystickyou can try to slow down the speed of the game by giving him downers and getting him drunkbut the fact of the matter is, no matter WHAT you do, Justin did NOT just lose his MvC2 crown. All he lost was a tournament in a slightly different game, from the one he rules in.  What you've done, by going to console, is made several thousand new players happy, but made the few hundred top-players who have stuck with the SF community through thick-and-thin VERY VERY unhappy. Because you've just destroyed the legitimacy of ALL of their tournaments, at the event that USED to be the most meaningful tournament of all.  Why do players like Seth, Chris Li, and others come out to SUPPORT console, despite the fact that the legitimacy of tournament play is degenerated? My guess would be that the games they were top-players inSuper Turbo and suchare no longer the top-played games at tournaments anymore. YES there are significant differences in the DC and arcade versions of ST, even MORE SO than MvC2 in some casesbut these guys have played so long that it doesn't matter. I don't think anybody is really going to put up a stink if Cole doesn't win ST at EVO this year, because the game is old. HELL, the SRK staff have been trying to GET RID of ST from the EVO lineup for years now. These OG players support console because, despite the fact that the game they ruled in is now old and losing interest, they want to see thousands of gamers come together and have a good time. If EVO is purely arcade-cabinet, this is not going to happenall you're going to have is a mass boredom and a bunch of happy top-players.  But CvS2, MvC2these games are still HOT. They are the two major games that SF players are coming to EVO to play, the REASON that most top players are coming. To destroy the legitimacy of the tourney play in these games is basically to say that the tournaments at EVO don't matter, and are only a side-attraction to the convention that EVO has become.  So we have the issue, and the problem. What is the solution?  It's pretty simple actually.  The Cannons have rented out two rooms at Cal Poly this year. Twice the space, GREAT idea.  One room should be totally for casual play. Unless you're playing in tournament, on deck to play, or have a vested interest in what's going on during a match (your teammate is playing, etc.), then you'll be in the casual play room. This room is strictly bring-your-own-console (and/or stick) to play casual play games, chill out, hang out, have fun and act stupid. Kill time between your tourney matches. Eat a big messy grinder over somebody's head and spill saunce on their back, whatever. Have a vid feed into this room from the tourney room, so if anywhere before the top 16 or 8 players there is a great match (like Justin vs Soo), EVERYBODY can see the match. This way, there is no RUSH FOR THE TOURNEY ROOM when a top match takes place.  Then there is the tourney-only room. The games are on arcade cabs, for the games that need to be: CvS2, MvC2, ST, 3s. If a game like Tekken is more commonly accepted on PS2 than on arcade, then that version is used; if not, arcade is used. Nobody can complain that matches mean nothing, nobody can complain that it's a different version of the game than that they're accustomed to; EVERYBODY is playing the most popular, well-accepted versions of their respective games. ALL serious tournament players are happy.  And, coincidentally, ALL casual-play players are happy.  The one forseeable problem with this perfect solution?  Money, and availability of cabinets.  But guess what?  The SRK staff have dug their own graves with this one. There is nobody to blame but themselves.  In all the efforts to \u201cevolve\u201d the Street Fighter community, to make it larger, more widespread, more accepted, EVO has become huge. There are so many players that qualifying rounds take too long, and there is nothing to do between matches. In the old days of a few hundred players, this was not a problem; but with the possibility of 1000+ players attending EVO, this is a DEFINITE problem that will occur.  But this is the problem that comes with growth.  Do PC game tournaments have one large-scale event, with all qualifiers, finals, and casual play all held at the same time?  HELL NO. They understand the money/time/availability constraints that come into play with tournaments.  But the organizers of EVO have not had the foresight to predict the problems that were inevitable when a tournament grows to the extent that EVO has. And now, EVO is put into the situation where either one side or the other gets screwedeither the majority of casual, normal players get screwed by being bored all weekend with nothing to do, or the top-players get screwed by being forced to make compromises on controls and versions of games they're not accustomed to. If you were a pro baseball player, and suddently you had to play with a whiffle ball bat, and the rules of the game were SLIGHTLY changedso much so that you weren't even sure what the difference was until you were tagged OUT and the game was overhow would you feel?  On the flipside, if you were a ballplayer, but you were only allowed to play one baseball game every 6 months, how would you feel THEN? Both situations suck.  What can be done?  The only thing that us, the common players, can do, is voice to the SRK staff that doing EITHER of these choices in unacceptable. It is absolutely unfair to demand EITHER a totally-console or totally-arcade cabinet tournament, because EVO has grown too large for either of these alternatives.  But rather than just voice our opinions, let's help out too. It's easy to just complain all day on the internet and do nothing constructive for the community. Instead of just whining and saying that the current state of EVO is unacceptable, let's help out for once.  I propose that everyone that reads this, donates $1 to SRK.  This may be next to nothing in the long run, but at least we are ALL at least doing SOMETHING to try to help out SRK, and show that we are willing to help out to make EVO the best tournament EVER. And I think that EVERYONE hereeven the poorest of the poor studentscan afford ONE DOLLAR.  There's nothing left to be said. To leave EVO as it is means to screw over a group of players, and that is unacceptable. So let's all show that we're willing to help SRK out of this slump of a problem by showing our support.  After all, we're all gamers here. All we want to see is Street Fighter be as successful as possible, and have the best goddamned \u201cevent\u201d that has ever been. So let's fucking stop talking and DO IT!", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: I think what we've all seen from this thread, and the copy of my post in Seth's sticky thread over in Fighting games discussion, is that  PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY MONEY IF THEY CAN PLAY ON THE CONTROLS AND VERSIONS OF THE GAME THAT ARE TOURNAMENT STANDARD.  If the Cannons would have just asked for help with EVO, this would have been discovered a long time ago.  However, they didn't. They just decided that they would make an event-changing decision without even consulting the people that \u201csupposedly\u201d the event is being held for.  I don't know if either of the Cannons, or Wizard, or any of the crucial SRK staff have read this thread, or my other replies. There have been no responses, so I have no idea. But if you want EVO to be without controversy, and TRULY the best ever:  Put on the main page of the site, that if you want both consoles AND arcade at EVO, to donate a few bucks.

{"text": "<YCR>: I guess I should give it all up. Actually caring about the community and the quality of tournaments, instead of the quantity of players, is a lost cause. Especially when the people who have the money and power to run a large-scale tourney like EVO are so closed-minded.  SRK has let themselves blow up their own heads, and egos. I guess that they think having EVO with 1000+ random people who don't really care and 100 good players who do care and are unhappy, is a good event. In my opinion, it's not. And I've been around since the days of World Warrior, and have seen every kind of tourney imaginable.  I tried to discuss things civilly with both Chris Li and Inkblot last night. Chris Li apparently got angry that I wanted to have a conversation or something, or else has never had a legitimate conversation over a chat programbecause for whatever reason he got mad that I wanted to talk and reply to his points, and signed off. Inkblot decided to stuff cotton balls in his ears and say \u201cI've said everything I have to say on SRK.\u201d  These are the people we want running the largest tournament, that represents our entire SF community?  Do we want a community where the voices of the top-playersmost of which have come out AGAINST the 100% console idea, except those affiliated with SRK to begin withare totally ignored? Not even addressed? Yeah, I'm sure the 1 minute \u201cvelcro stick\u201d video is going to assuade all my fears about the differences between DC and arcade versions of games, stolen sticks, malfunctioning sticks, and a host of other problems that nobody seems to want to talk about.  Give me a break. People said that my \u201cDEVO\u201d video from last year was going to divide the community. But if you REALLY want to divide the community, just ignore the opinions of the players who's voices should matter the most. Now you have the allegiance of 1000 new players and zero top-players.

{"text": "<YCR>: I'm not even going to argue about this, because it's pretty obvious you don't usually have long discussions on IRC, Chris.

On top of that, when I type on IRC, I type in single lines, not huge paragraphs. So I agree that it's hard to tell when somebody is done talking or going to keep going.  But that's why it's IRC. You can both spam lines all over and just read them, because they're all there in front of you. It's not like a conversation where somebody is \u201ctalking\u201d over somebody else.

NOBODY was begging the Cannons to start up the B-series of tournies, NOBODY begged them for SRK, NOBODY told them to promote themselves as the central tournament organizers for the United States. If SHGL had been on the East Coast, it would be EVO at the Break, not in Cali, and nobody would give a shit about the Cannons or SRK.  But that's the way it turned out. The Cannons have thrown their money around and with it have bought themselves the #1 US Street Fighter major. Only this year, they decided to change it, and turn it into a console casual play event.  Why not just cancel the fucking tournaments? That way you can have all the casual play you want. And no top players will come, because none of them will give a shit. We never came to tournies to fuck around with people; I'm sorry, but some Street Fighter players are the most nerdy, geeky, annoying, smelly, disgusting fucks on the planet. We just came to compete and make money, and have some good matches and some fun in the process.  But I guess that true feeling of real competition got lost somewhere, and got replaced with that desire to have your asses kissed by a million people who don't even know what Street Fighter is really about. That was proven when you decided to bring in non-serious fighting games like Smash Brothers. Give me a fucking break.  Have fun destroying your major tournament. There are things in the works that are going to blow SRK and EVO away anyway. The Cannons have been at the top of the US tournament scene for too long, and this is why they feel they can shit in the faces of the top players and get away with it. Because they'll come anyway by the chance to win a shitload of money from a billion scrubs.  But there are groups like Empire Arcadia, Top-Haters, and others who are breaking out and making a statement.

{"text": "<YCR>: && NO (Sounds like DSP, but its written by \"RedBeard\") Just curious, what is street fighter really about that the rest of us who are alright with a console tournament not understanding? To me it seems like you're all bitching about playing on a 6 foot box. Blah blahto be perfectly honest, I'd rather play a bunch of scrubs who didn't have sticks jammed all the way up their asses than play with a bunch of stuck up elitist whiny pricks. You guys are top whiners, not top players. If you're so awesome, beat everyone despite the SLIGHTLY uncomfortable conditions instead of giving up because you can't hold your elite arm in the exact correct position and one small game mechanic is different. You can stay home and complain about how horrible playing a console version game is and how everything is destroyed because of it while I have fun at EVO instead of wasting an eternity to play a single match.  Give it up and accept it. SRK isn't ignoring the players, they are DOING something that they truly believe will benefit the MAJORITY of people going instead of just kissing the asses of a handful of the top players who can't handle the switch. If only the absolute best are accepted to tournaments, you guys would A. Never make any money which makes it more interesting since so much is riding on it, and B. Nobody new would ever come around. You expect them to IGNORE the masses of people in favor of a couple of people who choose to IGNORE what playing console fixes and spend extra money just so you can play a little more comfortable and waste hundreds of other people's time in doing so?

I would go if they made MvC2 Arcade/Superguns.\u201d The results would be interesting so we had real numbers for at least people who came to the forums.  The people running this do this because they love the scene, and they need to accomodate everyone. Just because you are good at a video game doesn't mean shit. Your 30$ entry is just as much as everyone elses, and everyone else has to deal with the conditions. Honestly, don't come, and good riddance. Run your own tournament where only \u201ctop\u201d players can come, and enjoy it. Create a huge hole in your pocket by trying to run a large scale arcade tourney, and actually convince people to come worldwide for it. Good luck, since it's so easy and you're so utterly dissatisfied with this one, create your own.  Everyone likes arcades better, but people can play for MUCH cheaper on consoles, and it's a more viable available option. It's honestly not too much to ask to adaptIf they switched MvC2 to superguns then there would be no more complaints except people who honestly can't handle playing on a TV instead of a TV inside of a tall box. The gameplay change issues in MvC2 are very minor. It's not about Arcades in my opinion, it's about being a true fan of the game you play. I love arcades as much as the next guy, but they're dying. They are gonna totally die off soon unless some huge boom of gamers comes along to infest them, and holding a console tourney doesn't affect it one bit.  Whew.

{"text": "<YCR>: It's pretty sad that, as usual, suggestions to try to help the Cannons with getting an arcade-like setup have gone unheeded.  Someone suggested that, to preserve the integrity of the arcade-versions of games like MvC2 and CvS2, we go along with the console stick part, but hook arcade naomi boards up to a supergun. But this was shot down within 10 seconds, with the reply that naomis work \u201cweird\u201d with superguns, and need two power sources or more to work, and even then they're still buggy.  It looks like no matter what we do, this will be a console-only tournament. The pleas of the top-players in the CURRENT Capcom fighters will go unheeded.  There is nothing at all wrong with a console tournament. The problem is that EVO is being billed as the US Fighting Game Championships, and it's NOT that. It's just the largest console fighter tournament in the country, with a convention-like atmosphere. It's not serious competitive play for the ARCADE versions of these games.  So, if you play arcade and you're looking for one central US national to go toI suggest ECC (Seattle and many WC players will be attending this year) or MWC (which always has a decent turnout and HUGE comp for CvS2). If you just want to have some fun and hang out with players, go to EVO.

{"text": "<YCR>: Inkblot deleted his \u201cinspirational reply\u201d because it probably held no validity. Just like the rest of the nonexistent replies to my comments.  If Street Fighter dies, it's going to be from lack of new games, not by arcades dying. Moving to consoles isn't doing shit to \u201csave SF\u201d so get off your high horse. The problem here is that you have this idea in your head that SRK has been \u201csaving SF\u201d for years. It was always the players coming out that kept SF alive. You guys helped and did a lot to contribute to the communitybut don't act like the decisions you make are going to determine the fate of the entire community. Only the community can determine its own future.  Nobody is going to want to play MvC2 in ten years. Nobody will be playing SF at all if there are no new games at all, arcade or console. ST may be the exception, but let's face it, a handful of old men getting together once a year is not going to be considered \u201ckeeping SF alive.\u201d  If new games are released (on console no doubt) then the community will survive. The games will be played on console FROM THE START so no discrepancies between arcade and console versions will exist. Therefore, people will play on console from day 1 and have no argument against it.  My argument against console has always been that the arcade version, which has been tournament standard for 4+ years, is not being used for the biggest tournament in the country (and in the WORLD for MvC2). Controls have never been an issue; anyone can adapt to a console stick (if its held down somehow) so its not a valid argument. It's the differences between arcade and console versions that are sucking it up, and the compromise that is being forced down our throats isn't acceptable. For future games, this problem will not exist, but for games that have ALWAYS been played on arcade as the tourney standard, it just doesn't make sense.  The fact that some of the best players EVER in MvC2 are planning to NOT ATTEND the biggest tournament for that game IN THE WORLD should tip someone off. But I guess it doesn't matter, because an \u201cOG player\u201d who SRK is friendly with didn't say anything, and nobody is complaining about ST.  But I'm sure that if there was an outcry by Chris Li, Tragic, Seth, Valle, Choi, and other \u201cfriends of SRK\u201d that AE should be played at EVO instead of ST, it would be there. Right? But the fact that no \u201cfriends of SRK\u201d play MvC2 pretty much spells out the fact of how biased this is.  If anything is going to \u201ckill SF\u201d it's going to be the rifts you're creating in the community, and the lack of new Capcom games. NOT the fact that arcades are dying. SF players will always find a place to play THE FAVORITE VERSIONS OF THEIR GAMES whether or not it's in an arcade or not.  But forcing a change and shoving it down the top players' throats in the most popular fighting game EVER in the US, WITHOUT convincing them it's for the best, is just suicide for all of us.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: A lot of points, some more valid than others.  Why is 3s on supergun? In all honesty I have no idea. The same line of thinking that SRK is using with 3s apparently doesn't apply to MvC2.  3s is on supergun because of some minor differences in the DC and arcade versions. Notably, some character lose combos/infinites (Urien) and some lose some links (Ken's crouching medium punch into kick super). It's nothing game-ruining or unacceptable (considering the fact that no US players are good enough to use Urien at a Jap-level anyway) so the demand for supergun doesn't make sense. Keep in mind that SRK chose to have 3s on supergun THEMSELVES without consulting anyone, and gave no real reason for this selection besides the above mentioned reasons.  Now, look at MvC2. It's in exactly the same boat as 3s. Instead of having infinites missing, we have considerable game speed changes. Since MvC2 is arguably the fastest-paced fighting game ever, you would think that speed would be a factor. You also have significant chip damage differences (Doom's rocks, Cable's AHVB and other things do more) and regular damage differences (AHVBs do 10% more damage when they hit). On top of all this, some of the lesser-used characters such as Anakaris, who have touch-of-death strats that can destroy entire teams, do not work on the DC.  So, the question is, why does 3s get this special treatment, but MvC2 is overlooked? There's no logical explanation besides the fact that SRK staff do not properly understand the extent of changes beteween the arcade and console versions of the gamebut for some reason, they understand the changes in 3s. I talked to some of the \u201cfriends of SRK\u201d on IRC about this, including Seth and Sabre, and the only answers they had to give me were \u201cwhatever\u201d and \u201cwho cares.\u201d Well, I CARE, and so do the rest of the better players.  In my opinion, the changes in MvC2 are WORSE than the ones in 3s. This is favortism at its worst.  FMJ argues that catering to the top players only hurts the community. Well, you're right, you shouldn't ever cater to a small group of people. But YOU, THE SRK STAFF, have been the ones who decided that the arcade version of MvC2 would be tourney standard by having that version for years at your own major tournies. Now you're going to switch it for MvC2, screwing over that group of top players, while you keep supergun 3s for the same reasons that MvC2 players are complaining. There is no rationality behind this, besides favortism.  As for your comment about \u201csane people\u201d knowing that eventually SF would go to console, it depends on what you mean. Yes, all of us expect to see fighting video games go solely to console eventuallybut we're talking NEW games that come out. If a game has been played on an arcade version for years, and that is the tourney-accepted standard, it doesn't make sense to switch to console. But if a game is console-only or if the console version IS the accepted tournament standard, then there would be no problem. But to force people to play a different version of the game at the biggest tournament IN THE WORLD for that game, because you want to \u201csave time\u201d and \u201chave casual play\u201d is just assinine.  If you're going to complain about A3, get the facts straight. Yes, no accurate console version was ever ported, but you forget the fact that when the game was in arcades, it NEVER got the attention that MvC2 has gotten. It's a straight up fighter with bad hit boxes, that didn't have the widespread appeal that MvC2 does. I agree that some of the support from console versions that MvC2 has gotten was never available for A3, but when you compare the popularity of the two games, you can't deny that MvC2 was just more popular in arcades anyway. Besides, just TRY finding a LEGAL copy of MvC2 anywhereyou can't. And the majority of average gamers have no idea where to get an illegally ripped .iso to burn the game. Yet MvC2 is still the most popular fighting arcade game to date. Go figure.  I guess you also didn't read my full post, or any of the threads I've replied to, since you claim that I haven't given any kind of viable plan to get enough cabinets to EVO2k4. More than enough people have stepped up and straight out said they'd donate a decent amount of moneythe most I've heard is $100if it would help out to get some arcade machines there. A bunch of people have bought premium memberships simply because of my posts. Two people have said they would BUY cabinets if SRK would have the boards to put into them.  The problem here is not money; its not transportation or the availability of cabs or the unwillingness of people to help out and participate. The problem is that SRK has given us the \u201cbrick wall\u201d signal and simply wants to do it their way. They have thrown every excuse in the book at us to say that cabs are not neededfrom money, to velcroed sticks, to availability of cabs, to \u201cwho cares, console versions are close enough\u201dand showed no willingness whatsoever to openly discuss any of the issues. Any legitimate argument is either ignored or hated on by some huge post that raises valid points that have NOTHING to do with the argument at hand.  If anyone from SRK, including the Cannons, Wizard, Tragic, Seth, or anyone wants to get on here and start a VALID discussion of why such changes are taking placewithout hate, making fun, calling people \u201cwhiny scrubs\u201d or \u201celitists,\u201d then that would be acceptable. At least TRY to convince the community that this change is beneficial.  But being favortistic to the 3s players while the players of the tourney with the highest tournout are ignoreddoesn't make any fucking sense.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: I'm not trying to just \u201ckeep this thread going.\u201d I let it be for like a week, and then Inkblot replied with some bs, so I had to reply. Then you kept it going by replying.  In the long run, console isn't that big of a deal. I agree 100% control-wise because it's easier to just get used to a stick and play on that at EVO than to be surprised by some wacky loose/tight 360 that doesn't respond like your own. I also agree that new fighting games will be played on console 100%, because arcades are slowly but surely disappearing.  I just feel that forcing the best players in the world to play on a format they're not familiar on is unfair. That's all. I always speak up when I feel something is unjust, and I take a lot of heat for it. It's not like I expect to place at EVO, I just know that a few of the top-players are seriously considering not going (names you would be VERY surprised to hear) because of the console situation.  Casual-play wise console makes sense. But in a competitive tourney atmosphere for a game thats been on arcade forever, it doesn't. I'm sorry but the hundreds of players who will \u201cbenefit from being able to play on console because they don't have any local arcades to play at\u201d are NOT GOING TO PLACE AT EVO. It's going to be the same players who have been at the top and who we all expect to be there. You're not going to see Joe Scrub get third place because, all of a sudden, he was allowed to play on a d-pad instead of an arcade cab. So the switch to console has NO POSITIVE ASPECTS WHATSOEVER besides not having to physically bring boards/cabs there, and possibly saving an hour or two.  But all the probs with sticks, handicaps being switched, DCs and other things frying out, controversy with pause button/analog button presses, etc., is going to take JUST AS LONG as if they had played the entire tourney on console all along. Even TRAGIC did an accidental pause last year, and if that happens in a heated match at EVO, I'm going to call for a disqualification no matter what.  There\u2019s going to be a lot of bitching, a lot of trouble with sticks, a lot of issues, and no saving of time at all. But rather than discuss the issues, those in charge of EVO have decided to stick cotton balls in their ears. They\u2019ll be sorry.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: Editorial: The Last Hurrah (Goodbye)  It was recently brought up in the ECC Grudge match discussion thread on SRK...and rightly so....that I'm looking for recognition in all the wrong places. I've never placed in a major tournament, and that's what counts.  This point is absolutely correct.  I barely enter tournies. What can I say? I go to one maybe once every 2-3 months with little to no practice. I've pretty much been making money matches and using the tournament as a warmup. If there were more tournies in the CT area and I didn't have to drive anywhere from 2-4 hours to get to one, I would play more and place.  But that's not the situation. Unlike a lot of the kids who play marvel, I have a busy life. I go to school full time (graduating in May) and work 20 hours a week, in between schoolwork. I play marvel maybe 1-2 times a week if I get the chance, against the same people over and over.  Although I've never placed at a major tournament, I've beaten the best before. On both coasts. Or gone pretty damn close. So has Kevin Smith from CT.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, you're not going to see me winning tournaments, because I don't enter them. I probably play the least out of all the top players on the East Coast. I don't have a place to play like Philly, CTF, or Florida, where there are central arcades that people can play all the time, attend tournies, and get good. I've gotten good by playing on shitty controls in CT and attending a rare tourney here and there.  I haven't been pissed off as much about not getting mentioned, as much as seeing guys like Infinite getting name drops all over the fucking place. There are people just as good or better who aren't getting mentioned, and it pisses me the fuck off. If I had a place like CTF in my backyard to play, and I had as much free time as these kids, I'd be raping people all over the place. But I just don't.  Look....  Street Fighter has always been my hobby. I've been playing since World Warrior, and got into the competitive scene with MvC1. SF has always been a part of the recreational part of my life....a way to have fun and blow off steam, while meeting people from all walks of life, from all over the world, that I otherwise would have never met. SF has brought me a lot of joy, and I'm grateful. But that chapter of my life is coming to a close.  As much as I want to say that I'll be playing SF forever, I know it's not true. It's already dying in the form that I grew up with: arcades. They won't exist soon enough. Combine that with the fact that I'll be getting a job......a REAL, 40-60 hours a week, Monday through Saturday job.....after I graduate, coupled along with bills, my own car, my own place, and other shit that's going to take up most of my time....and as much as I want to, I know there won't be room for SF in my life anymore, besides maybe attending ECC. It's going to be more for reminiscing and chilling with old friends than anything else.  I know I've never placed in a tournament. You're preaching to the choir. I'm mad at myself for not having the discipline to do that. But other things have always come in the way. This year, for the first year ever, I honestly feel I can be considered top 10 MvC2 on the East Coast. I don't know why...it's probably because most of the stuff in the game has been found, and gave me a chance to play catch-up with the rest of the players.....but I feel I'm good enough. No bullshit.  I don't even know if I'm going to MWC or EVO as much as I'd like to. Most likely my job will conflict with that. The Top-Haters are going to fade away into nothing. There won't be time to maintain the site anymore, to stir up controversy, to be one of the few voices to speak out against \"the majority\" of SF authority. Someone else is going to have to pick up the reigns.  Come ECC, it's all going to be different. It's not going to just be another tourney for me to fuck around at and lose. It's not going to be time to make excuses and complain about controls. It's not going to be time to back down and get tired and quit and lose and give up.  It's going to be time to put up, or shut up. And if you know me, you know I don't shut up much. I'm going to play my hardest, use all this HATE to fuel me, and prove to the community that I grew up with, and hopefully helped build, that ANYONE can do ANYTHING and overcome EVERYTHING if they have enough determination and heart to do it.  In short, you're not going to see DSP, or Phil Burnell, the King of Hate, or Darksyde Phil, or WhoaMoses, or \"the guy who got punked by Jaha,\" or Monkeyspank, or anything else at ECC. You're going to see the most determined player you've ever met. Don't take me lightly anymore. I'm not a one-team wonder or a Cable whore anymore. I'm just a man, a player giving everything he's got to win.  For most of the East Coast, it will probably be the last time you'll ever seen me in a tournament.  As much as I want to say no, I don't accept this, I really do. This is going to be it for me, unless by some miracle I get to show up at MWC and EVO, which I would love.  But chances are, ECC is the last hurrah.  I'm hungry. Hungrier than ever before. And at ECC, I'm going to FUCK YOU UP.  I wouldn't know a better way to say goodbye.  ~DSP", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: MapQuest is the fucking shiznit  I'm sure that many of you have used MapQuest before to get driving directions to someplace you otherwise had no idea how to get to. I used this free service on New Years' Eve (of all times) to get to a party at a house I'd never been to. Already fashionably late, I quickly typed in the addresses, printed out the directions, and sprinted out the door.  My friend Kong was driving and we drove for about 20 minutes, out into the middle of fucking nowhere. Pitch black, no sense of direction or where we are, we finally arrive at our destination after a good 35 minutes...making us an hour and 35 minutes late, and a mere two hours or so away from midnight and kicking in the new year.  So, who's at this happening party?  Absolutely  Fucking  NOBODY.  Why?  Because the party is at a closed farmers' market.  ...at least according to MapQuest.  I began to stare down at the paper in disbelief. We had followed the directions to a T. How could we have possibly ended up at such a wrong place, when we were in a race for time (and getting some ass)?  Take a look for yourself:  I could not fucking believe what I was seeing. We had typed in the correct address and done everything right. MapQuest was just too fucking dumb to know the difference between Bronson ROAD and Bronson AVENUE.  That would be fine if they weren't 10 fucking miles in the opposite direction from each other.  So let me get this straight, if I put in Brooklyn Ave, NY, would it have me drive off the fucking end of the Brooklyn bridge instead?  And the kicker is the end of the page. It blatantly says \"END at 1174 Bronson ROAD\", while less than a fucking centimeter above it most clearly ends at Bronson AVE.  So to conclude the story, we finally found the house on our own merits around 10:30pm. When we arrived, everybody was either high or drunk as hell, and making a LOT of fucking noise in a rich neighborhood. We decided to get the hell out of there before the cops arrived.  I guess MapQuest is run by a bunch of drunk retards who don't understand the difference between different types of streets. Which I guess should be expected from a free website that thousands of people use on a daily basis for reliable driving directions.  Save yourself some trouble and use Yahoo Directions. Ironic how the company that's going under is way more accurate.   ~DSP", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: Decent turnout, 21 players plus one super-late entry (Rob Aponte). This tournament featured buy-backs for players who lost before the next to last round of losers, they were stuck into a buy-in bracket and had a play off to see who would get back into the real tournament again. Here are the results:  1. Desmond \u201cXecutioner\u201d Pinkney 2. Phil \u201cDSP\u201d Burnell 3. Shoe, the old-school MvC1 player who amazingly comes back and whups everybody's ass 4.

Jeff \u201cGohanFan\u201d Cibulus, Jermaine Jenkins, and Phong \u201cSpeedy\u201d Nguyen 9. Tristan Levy, Rohan, Oliver Chang, Fred, and Chris S.  The winners of the buy-back-in brackets were Chris Ellis and Speedy, but they lost to Kong and Shoe, respectively. Chris Ellis lost to Kong TWICE in this tournament, but only because he bought back in. Shoe lost to DSP twice because it was losers' finals.  Comments:  -Walter \u201cBacardiJ3di\u201d Padilla tried to pull a fast one by LYING and saying he beat Christian, when they never even played. This totally fucked up the brackets and I had to stick Christian into a later buy-back round because Walter had lied, and already got eliminated from the tourney before I could fix anything. -Shoe came out of NOWHERE and decided to kick everybody's ass today. The guy doesn't even play MvC2 but you may remember him from MvC1 days. -Kong, for the first time ever, decided to do well in a tournament and got 4th. He was going to go to work but decided to call out and stay, and he did well. By the way Kong, you left your pizza so Shoe and I ate it :smiley: can't let it go to waste. -Winners finals was DSP vs Desmond, which Des won 3-1. Finals was a repeat, 4-1. Pretty much I couldn't block anything Des's Magneto did on our sticks, which is funny because I could block everything Sanford did with Magneto at CTF a few weeks ago. Either our cabs controls are too close to each other so I can't get the correct angle to block fast, or the sticks aren't as good as CTF's. But I'm sure as hell that I knew how to block that basic high-low stuff he was doing. -Dru just doesn't understand the fact that you can't buy back in if you're in 5th place when you lose; that's just too far. He kept complaining that I wouldn't make an exception for him, when I kept explaining to him that everyone else that re-entered lost two rounds before him, and would most likely easily lose to Shoe and Kong anyway. He was upset, but oh well, I'm a FAIR tournament director and I can't make exceptions.

I'd like to play Desmond in another set to gauge myself and see how much better I've gotten, but last time we played, he beat me 5-3. Pretty close.  Sanford? The man has always been a beast. YES he should be on the team, but he needs to get pumped up and have proper coaching. Without it he gets nervous and will make mistakes. He's the next Justin IMO and he should be on the team 100%. AND I also want to play Sanford in a setI haven't played him in ages for more than 1 game at a time.  Justin Wong. Nuff' said.  SO, whoever the hell on this list thinks they're outright better than me, and deserves a spot on this fucking team over me, come and prove it. AGAIN, I've beaten:  -Demon Hyo -Josh Wigfall -Isaac -Infinite  All convincingly before, some in tourney play. I'm really fucking insulted that my name hasn't come up. If you're going to disrespect me just because I don't win tournies (because I rarely go and I don't CARE) then come and prove you're better than me.  FUCK man, you guys really pissed me off bad this time.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil, Punish3r, dXp"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: The reason that the EC team lost last year is that there was no unity at all. Besides maybe Justin and Ricky it was a bunch of individuals trying to show off, and it failed miserably.  In order for the EC to win this year, the team has to be unified. EVERYBODY has to feel that everybody on the team deserves to be there and trusts the other teammates to win. They have to help each other out, pump each other up, and get psyched to beat the WC players. Remember, WC has home court advantage. And the rest of the coast has to be behind this team 100%.

{"text": "<YCR>: I'm going to respond to some of the ridiculous things in this thread HERE. Then I'll post my legitimate feelings on how to improve the SBO quals over in the \u201cTeam SBO 2005\u201d thread in tournies and events.  Comment: A lot of people from the WC have tried to defend themselves saying \u201cHEY, it's the WC that talks to Japan and gets the SBO stuff going! We do all the work! Who are YOU fucks to complain???\u201d  Reply: Nobody chose to have it that way. It just turned out that way because the B-series tournies were always on the WC, as well as the SHGL tournies that used to be big. It would only make sense that the SRK staff would be the ones to talk to them, because the closest US major to Japan is in Cali.  But when you're talking SBO, you're talking having a team that represents the entire United States, so having the WC in charge of it 100% is NOT acceptable. It's one thing if you're arranging accomodations for EVO, and totally another if you need to discuss SBO arrangements with Japan for an entire nation.  BUT, Kuni is friendly with SRK staff and so he talks to them. Maybe if somebody else besides SRK stepped up to the plate and tried to stay in contact with Kuni, we could get something else going. Jason Wilson has already expressed this interest.  Comment: Yeah, the turnout for SBO quals was low (as little as 9 players) but the normal double elim tournies were maxed out at 32! So it wasn't that the tourney was a failure as much as everyone was cheap and nobody wanted to fork over the $25.  Reply: Never before has such an incorrect comment been stated. The problem wasn't the $25 entry fee, it was the fact that NO OTHER PLAYERS GOOD ENOUGH TO PLACE (or who felt they were good enough to place) WERE PRESENT. If you're a scrub or a mid-level player, it would be fun to enter a normal tourney, but not so fun to put yourself up the elite players who are willing to pay $25 to enter. After they're done wiping the floor with you, you'll wonder what crack you were smoking, or how much crack you could have bought with the money you just wasted.  The problem, again, as many have stated, is that SBO quals are held on the WC. Because of bad communication with Japan, things were thrown together last minute, dates, mixed up, shit gone wrong. Ben couldn't even be there because nothing was concrete, and then he ended up having to be somewhere else for a job. I don't blame him. EVERYONE just needs to get their shit together.  The cost of the EC players (who could have possibly qualified) flying to Cali was not worth it. The tourney dates were uncertain, and with other things going on over here, it wasn't worth the trip for these guys. Yeah, Justin may win every MvC2 tourney he enters, but do you think he wants to spend all that money flying to Cali 3-4 times a year? THEN having to pay to go to Japan on top of that? I don't. It's really easy for WC heads to take a defense that the EC hasn't tried to organize SBO quals, but that's just not true. We haven't been given the chance to organize them because we're not in contact with Kuni like SRK is. And rapidly fluctuating, uncertain dates for something you need to buy expensive plane tix for in advance is just not worth the trouble.  Comment: \u201cIf you don't like it, you don't have to come, and a lot of players apparently didn't. That's not our fault.\u201d  Reply: Actually, it is. EVO caused a lot of controversy this year by saying that they were converting totally to console. If you don't like it, you don't have to come. And this is legitimate to say in this case.  Why? Because there are two or three other perfectly good major tournaments you can attend that are on console (ECC, MWC etc.). So you have other places to go if you're so adamant about playing on a big hulking wooden cab, and the arcade versions of those particular games.  BUT FOR SBO THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE. You can't say \u201cFuck family fun, that shit is too far and the controls suck, I'm going to the Montgomerey, Alabama SBO quals instead!\u201d Again, by putting all the power into the hands of the WC, you've destined yourselves to fail. The quals need to be nationwide so that people that can't travel all overor don't like a particular arcade for whatever reasoncan go where they want. If they win there, its their own fault, so they should be responsible to pay their way to the \u201ccentral finals\u201d wherever they may be.  By having the WC responsible 100% for SBO quals, you put an unfair amount of responsibility upon them. Family Fun can't be blamed for not drawing EC players for SBO, because they didn't choose to have a monopoly on the quals. It was placed upon them. I'm sure next year that arcade would be just as happy to have a REGIONAL qualifiers held there and not have all this drama put upon them.  Now, I have two general comments to make.  First and foremost, a lot of the players in this thread are too fucking cocky. Shittalking is cool and fun, and builds up drama and competition, yeah. But when you outright insult others it just doesn't work. Justin is sure to start every comment about SooMighty with \u201cI respect him as a player and a person, BUT\u201d before he throws his wallet onto the sidewalk and states \u201cI BET ALL MY MONEY ILL BEAT HIM AT ECC!\u201d You gotta have respect for your fellow players before all else. If you don't, it just gets ugly. So please, observe some caution when you post.  SECOND  And this is the most important point I think I've ever made  It DISGUSTS me to hear that players on any competitive level have thrown matches and/or forfeit and \u201cscrewed over\u201d others. This is absolutely unacceptable and I'm very pissed off to hear about it.  It's one thing when 1st and 2nd in a double elim tourney are really close friends, so one of them throws the match and you split the money. Nobody is screwed here besides themselves, because they denied themselves the right to have a competitive match they could have learned from.  But in a round robin, throwing matches/forfeits is just not acceptable. Trying to get your friends to qualify just proves that they couldn't get there on their own, and they suck. Seriously.  Throwing matches in a round robin just shows that you have absolutely no respect for who is there, but instead you just want to fuck everyone else besides you and your friend. People who throw matches like this should never be able to enter competitive tournaments ever again, because it's just not respectful and acceptable. You don't get to be disrespectful in pro sports without getting punished, and you sure as HELL don't get to throw tournament-level games, and it should be the same way here.  And to ANNOUNCE that you're forfeiting and/or throwing the match is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Whoever did that should have been immediately ejected from the tourney and their place erased. I would have done it if I ran the tournament, and I've run my share of large tournies before and helped at ECC, so don't try to give me your diatribe about how I know nothing of how to run shit. First and foremost always is the integrity and reliability of the tournament results, and when you're allowing someone to throw shit like that, it just makes a mockery out of the years of hard work and practice that the players attending have put into the game.  That's all. I hope that next years SBO quals are way better than this year was. And I hope that this year's team does well, whether or not they deserve to be over there.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil, Punish3r, dXp"}}

{"text": "<YCR>: There are a few things you have to learn here, before you start posting.  First, don't ever argue with, or acknowledge, anything FMJ has to say. He does not go to tournaments outside of his hometown, he has never been to a SF major, and he won't be at EVO. He will, however, pick apart every little thing you say in order to find a mistake, then point it out to make you look stupid. Why? Because he's a loser who sits at home all day and makes it a point to do so. Comfront him on IRC on why he's always in channels like #capcom when he doesn't play SF and isn't a part of the active SF community, and he'll get quiet really fast.  Now, theres someting else you need to know. If you talk to INTELLIGENT gamers, they will understand that switch sticks give you more accurate control, since there are actual corners on the sticks. However, for whatever reason (SHGL's influence?) over the past 3-4 years 360s have become the standard for SF games. It's true that for the more straight-up games like 3s, ST etc. switch sticks are probably superior, but a LOT of players have only been around since 360s have been usedto ask for a change to switch sticks for MvC2/CvS2 etc. would just be impractical and pretty stupid, since the majority of players have played these games on 360s from the start, and switch sticks would most likely just throw them off and create more complaints than positive side effects.  HOWEVER, having an option of one or the other type of stick probably makes a lot of sense. Of course, that would take a hell of a lot more organization, planning, and time to implement (what kind of sticks do you prefer for each game? etc. and then having to get that person to that type of cabinet, etc.). With the addition of FIVE new tournaments this year, I'm not seeing any time or resources available to implement anything of this magnitude.  I just guess there are two kinds of improvement. One focuses in on the gaps and problems from past tournaments and tries to fix/improve upon them. Another focuses on throwing in new things to attract new types of players and appease new fanbases. The Cannons have opted for the second type of improvement for EVO2k3, and only time will tell if it was the correct choice.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil, Punish3r, dXp"}}

There doesn't have to be an \u201cautograph table\u201d at EVO or any other tournament; the idea itself is absurd, because SF players aren't celebrities, they're just normal people.

GGXX won with the worst character in the game! Four REAL marvel players actually show up for marvel!

{"text": "<YCR>: If people are saying that sticks sucked just because they were switch, that's really fucking lame. But if shit was really fucked up, at a major, that's inexcusable (but not the first time it's happened at any major).  Jason, I'm not trying to get attention; if I were, I'd change my nick to DSP and spout out top-haters.com propaganda all day long. I just didn't appreciate all the shittalk you spouted out on IRC about how ST @ ECC was a non-skillfest, when your own tournament sucked. Low turnout, fucked up controls, and complaining that nobody came when you moved it to the middle of nowhere didn't help either. Also having NO spare 360s was a BIG mistakeand not having 360s for the games that are accustomed to using them (MvC2) was a big no-no. Switch on ST is okay, but when you've been playing MvC2 for 4+ years on 360s, you begin to depend on them.  Ever since last year, I thought you were cool; but then when I started to say I was a top ST player on the EC, if not THE top player, you flipped and started acting like an ass. Who is better than me, then? Ricky Ortiz, Spence who always beats me but loses to certains character for free, and Henry Cen. Considering I play the game seriously three to four times a year at most, and I wasn't OG like you guys and don't have those years of experience to fall back on, I would say that's pretty damn good. But god forbid a player who was born after 1980 say he thinks hes good at a game pre-Alpha 3. The fact that you even played ST back when switch sticks were still the standard speaks volumes. But I never asked to be ranked in your shitty \u201cTricks and Trips\u201d magazine, so I don't understand why you acted like you did. Maybe if you seriously did get off of Watson, Ricky, and Gee-O's nuts for a few minutes, you would realize there are other players.  At least Cole respects me for learning the basics and winning with an obscure character like Blanka. I'm sure if I played O.Sagat all the time like Ricky I would destroy 99% of my opponents too. I'm also sure that if I was a bum like him, I'd have way more time to play SF. Unfortunately, I also enjoy the fun factor of SF, which is probably why I'll never be a top player. Of course, when you foolishly open your mouth on IRC and then get caught out online because 1. your tournament sucked and 2. you dissed EVERY ST player in attendance at ECC, it makes it all that much easier to be a top-hater.  P.S. When we do play ST, you can hook it up with Pac-Man sticks, since I'm sure that's what you're more accustomed to, old man.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "Punish3r"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: I have to agree with Jason here that 360s are garbage and switch sticks are better. Connecticut had switch sticks up until a few months ago, so I'm used to playing MvC2 on both types of joystick, and I have to argue that although 360s are more responsive (just slightly move in a direction and your character responds), switch sticks are more accurate. Why? Because SF is and always has been an 8-direction game. You don't need 180 points of control, you need 8. Why do you think SO many people get Magneto's air \u201cboomerang\u201d projectile while trying to triangle dash? It's because on 360s, there are about 40 more points of movement detection up there that registerthe sticks are so sensitive, that if you pressed, down->up to superjump, then tapped down-toward plus two punches to airdash, chances are the stick \u201cbrushed\u201d up against some of those up-toward direction registries, giving you that rather useless projectile and costing you a free combo attempt.  Try triangle dashing on a switch stick (after a little practice, of course) and notice the difference. Also, try blocking Magneto rushdown on a switch vs a 360 and you'll REALLY begin to understand the difference when you can snap to those corners and avoid getting high-low tricked to high heaven. The fact of the matter is, about 25% of the time you snap to back or down-back on a 360, you get a backdash, jump back, or normal crouch rather than a block; on a switch you'll get what you wanted about 95% of the time.  Now, this is all providing that people were just complaining about switch sticks that worked.

Now there are about 8000 hardcore MvC2 players so I'm not stupid enough to claim something like that. As for ST, some of the people you mentioned I've beaten in tournament, some have beaten me, some have gone both ways, and some I've never even heard of, or just haven't played recently. MAYBE if you showed up at ECC, and saw me win $250 for playing pretty shitty (I was off my game due to no practice), and then saw me tearing it up outside on the casual setup, and then saw my team get second place in the team tourney, losing only to TEAM GOD (Seth/Julian/Cole), then I think you would sing a different tune.

That's the part you can control. What you can't control is if this girl goes around spreading rumors and talking shit. You could go around trying to create a counter-campaign disproving what she says, but in all honesty it's not worth it. It will just make you look desperate to protect yourself, and guilty. Chances are that if this girl keeps going around making insults and comments, and her friends do as well, people will begin to think that she's the idiot for going on about it. Best thing you can do in a situation like that, is let it die. Don't talk to her, don't talk ABOUT her, just pretend she doesn't exist. Do whatever you must to erase her from your life. Block her on IM, change your phone number, whatever. I did that once and it worked wonders. Important thing to remember is 1. it's not the end of the world, 2. it will eventually die out and be forgotten by all, 3. there are a million other chicks out there who won't do that to you and 4. it's not worth getting worked up about. Just some dumb broad who won't mean a dime to you in the long run. Just chill out and stop stressing about it.

{"text": "<YCR>: I just posted something in another forum, that relates to women. When I wrote it, something had struck a nerve, and I was pretty pissed off. I don't want any of you girls here to think that I'm writing about you, because I really don't know any of you well enough to make a judgement call (well, 99.9% of you anyway), so don't take this personally. It's just that every woman I've ever known has let me down. Anyway, I just wanted to see what you guys thought about what I had to say. Here goes:  \u2014There are really \u201ctruly interesting and wonderful women?\u201d Shit, every woman I've ever known was either  1. Extremely selfish and self-centered 2. Too busy feeling sorry for herself to do anything else 3. Too annoying and/or geeky to stand for more than 30 minutes 4. Too stupid to listen to advice they ASK FOR, doing stupid things and then complaning to you because they went totally against what you told them 5. A total slut 6. A total tease, leading you on and then crushing you under their boot when you finally let on that you like her 7. A total liar 8. So demanding that she expects you to read her mind like some kind of fucking psychic, and NEVER do anything unless it's with her (don't be fooled, if she says you can go do something and she doesn't mind, she's LYING and you'll pay for it later!) 9. Too full of herself 10. Just plain fucking crazy.  Every single woman in my life fits one or more of the above, and every single one has let me down.  You want to know why so many guys are so \u201cuninteresting, full of themselves, thinking they are the shit?\u201d BECAUSE WOMEN DEMAND IT. If a guy has no confidence, then that's no good. Women always whine they want \u201ca nice guy\u201d and there are none of them left. Give me a fucking break! Women WALK ALL OVER nice guys, use them, abuse them, play with their hearts, but in the end they ALWAYS fuck them over (cheat on them, break up with them, tell them \u201clets just be friends\u201d or you \u201cneed tim eapart\u201d but then run off with some other guy, blah blah blah). The fact of the matter is, the women of America have become so fucking selfish, dishonest, and full of themselves, they have no fucking idea what it is they really want from a man. This is why so many guys have become that same \u201coverconfident asshole\u201dbecause if we're nice guys, we get walked all over, and thrown away, because we're too \u201cboring\u201d or whatever other stupid fucking reason you give. At least if we act like total dicks, we can get laid once in a while.  Damned superficial bitches. If you could make up your fucking minds what you wanted out of men, maybe more guys would try to be like that. But instead, you're never satisfied, and you go on forums complaining that \u201call guys are the same overconfident assholes.\u201d Well maybe if you weren't sleeping with or dating that type of guy, and/or cheating on/turning down that \u201cnice guy\u201d for that asshole stereotype you so loudly proclaim to be bad, so many guys wouldn't be trying to be like that in the first place. Dumbass!  So yeah, poon is good, video games are good, but women are a fucking waste of time and the #1 cause of bullshit and drama that men don't need.

Unfortunately, I had to work from 10am to 10pm today at Circuit City, only to realize that they're at it again.  That's right, once again stores are cashing in on the commercialism of the holiday season with their \"after-Christmas sales.\" Best Buy, Staples, Circuit City, WalMart, and a load of other stores are all offering their so-called deals in one form or another. And once again, they are just lying to you and trying to fool your ass into getting into the store, and buying something more expensive than you wanted (plus all accessories and protection plans, i.e. PURE PROFIT, of course!).

All for $1000 (after rebate, which is just another scam hoping you'll forget to send them in).  The catch: THEY DON'T HAVE THEM. This notebook has been sold out since before Christmas at EVERY CIRCUIT CITY in the tri-state area. And it's not available for special order, so no rain checks allowed. As you've probably guessed, this is the same for pretty much every notebook that has a \"red dot sale\" this week, as well as 95% of digital cameras.  What about desktop computers? The supposed red-dot sales on those are exactly the same prices as from before Christmas. Some sale.  And the big scam continues. Yet, people are still packing the stores, and will be all weekend.

{"text": "<YCR>: A lot of people have thrown their hat into the ring here, and I think I should too. As a former tournament organizer, I know the problems that come along with consoles. So here's what I feel is not going to work at EVO:  No matter what game you're playing, no matter what console, when you force people to bring their own sticks, you have problems. And here's why:  1. A lot of players who are into certain gamesnamely the CvS2 and MvC2 crowdsdo not play those games on console on a consistent basis. The majority of the \u201ctop-players\u201d in these games learned them in arcades. In fact, unlike a lot of games like SC2, Tekken, GGXX, and others, these games are played primarily in arcades, because they actually make money; it's easy to find them in arcades, unlike the other games.  Switching over to a console is basically going to leave the majority of educated players, who learned these games in arcades, at a disadvantage, being used to playing on an arcade-level cabinet that is stationary. By switching these two particular games over to console, you are actually giving an unfair advantage to those who have played the games seriously on this format before, while handicapping a lot of America's top players who refuse to play on console.  2. Going along with the above, not all players own their own console sticks. I've been playing MvC2 since the day the japanese copy was released, but I never owned a console stick until a month or so agoand it's a shitty agetec. But that's just an example.  You're going to have a significant number of players coming to EVO that do not own their own sticks, or do not feel confident playing on them in a tournament. So you're going to need a LOT of loaners unless you want to see hundreds of DQs, or lots of delays.  Another problem comes up if someone enters multiple tournaments. Should someone be expected to bring a DC stick for Capcom games, and then a PS2 stick for GGXX and 3d games? That's a lot of baggage to be carrying around, and I really doubt it's going to work out if everybody is walking around with a joystick.  3. Maintaining who's stick is whose is going to be a fucking nightmare. Trust me on this one. Shit is going to get stolen like crazy, and you're going to have no way to prove anything, or kick anybody out who you catch UNLESS you hire some hardcore security.  4. If a stick/button breaks on an arcade cab, you can fix it in seconds. If one breaks on a console stickespecially during a serious tournament like EVO where they will be played on more and harder than ever beforeit's going to be another nightmare to get them fixed. Some sticks like Agetecs can't have their switches replaced, and some of these kids won't have a clue what to do to fix the stick. That's an auto DQ simply because of a stick malfunction, and it will cause a lot of controversy and complaints.  5. It's pretty much accepted that when you combine certain sticks, namely an Agetec with a MAS stick, you can have some serious probs with burning out controller ports, or random pauses, on a DC. There is nothing at all you can do to remedy this situation. You're just going to have to tell one or the other player that they can't play on their favorite stick, and that's just not fair. Or else you're going to have to replace the ports on numerous DCs, and figure out how to deal with random pauses.  6. This is pretty much MvC2-specific, but considering that (ignoring Smash Brothers) MvC2 will be the biggest numbers draw of any game at EVO  MvC2 is a game that absolutely demands a sturdy, steady base to play on. Marvel is the most control-invensive fighting game ever createdpressing down, then up hard on a stick, jerking down-forward while smashing two punches together, then pressing several more buttonsfast flying with sentand lot of of other stuff just REQUIRES stationary controls.  There is no way to get around this. I've tried to emulate playing on an arcade cab at home in numerous waysincluding strapping down a joystick to a chair and trying to get it to stay stilland the ONLY way to get this to work is to physically glue something down. Which won't be feasible at EVO.  Having MvC2 on console at EVO benefits no one. Nobody is going to care that there is more time for casual play if they can't do anything in the tourney, simply because of controls. If you want to have a casual play section for MvC2, then make it separate, and make it console. But the tournament should absolutely be played on arcade cabinets, 100% of the timenot just finals.  If anyone disagrees with this, I guarantee you either 1. have played MvC2 on console from day 1, and so are either used to playing on your own personal stick, or simply don't do advanced tactics like fast fly, or 2. you are biased because you either don't like MvC2, or don't play it.  I look forward to discussing this topic further.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}

Besides Philly, who all of the tri-state area own for free on a regular basis. We've won so much money from those guys that it's not even funny.  If you're going to illustrate a point, get your facts straight. If the top 4 placers at a console tourney are the best players there, totally on another level from everyone else, then they're obviously going to get top 4 whether its on console or not. But at EVO, where people of arguably equal skill level play, then there's going to be bloody murder when someone can't fast fly, or superjump, or pushblock, and instead eat four viper beams because it's console.

{"text": "<YCR>: Someone asked what the criteria that SRK are using to see if a console version of a game is \u201cclose enough\u201d to be used instead of arcade version.  The answer?  There are no criteria. SRK has consulted no one on the matter, besides those close to SRK. Namely the staff and a handful of OG players.  If you've been reading, you would know that about 90% of the top MvC2 players who post on SRK have come out against the console switch.  3s was decided to be on supergun. Why? Why does 3s get different treatment from MvC2? There was no reasoning or rationale for this. The differences in 3s between arcade and consolenamely Urien's infinites/juggles being changed/removed and the removal of some links and other minor tweaks here and thereare just as superficial as the speed/damage and character changes in MvC2 (namely Anakaris). Let's face it, the one or two people who are good enough to do the Urien infinite stuff on the arcade 3s would be just as pissed off about a console switch, as Viscant is about not being able to play Anakaris now that MvC2 is console. The only difference isnothing.  SRK has decided to be favortistic to 3s players by using supergun setups and original arcade boards. But no reasoning has been given to why this won't be done with MvC2 besies \u201cNaomi games are weird with supergun.\u201d  Also, ST is being played on DC. If you know anything about ST, you know that DC ST is totally different from arcade. First and foremost, there is a HUGE lag from when the game says FIGHT and you can actually move your player. So the beginning of every round is totally different from what you can do on arcade. On top of that, the size and reach of characters has been changed. So has some damage scaling and some links. Basically DC ST is a game KIND of like arcade ST, but not really. There are enough significant changes to call it a totally different game. But NOBODY HAS PLAYED THIS VERSION SERIOUSLY ENOUGH in a competitive environment to notice these changes. I'm willing to bet that a lot of players will have a rude awakening come EVO.  However, the OG players (who primarily play ST) that are \u201cFriends of SRK\u201d have said they're going to make a sacrifice and accept this version. There really hasn't been any real justification of this. My guess is that they're doing it for the good of EVO, since it's going to be all console anyway, and it's not worth putting up a stink about. ST will probably have the lowest turnout of the four SF games at EVO anyway. But it's still interesting to note that nobody has come out and said how different DC ST is from the arcade version.  So, there are no criteria to judge how close a version is to arcade and if the console version is acceptable. If there were criteria, MvC2 would be played on superguns just like 3s. It's pretty much just those in charge deciding random things with no rationale behind it at all.  At least, that's what we're left to think. Since nobody has come on and given any legitimate reason for what's being done with 3s. But I guess it doesn't matter since we're not part of SRK, and we're all going to attend EVO. We're not important enough to know", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: Sigh.  More hate. Which is to be expected I guess. SRK hasn't legitimately discussed any of this, only hated on those who speak up against it. For example, take a look at Seth's Domination 101 post. Give me a break.  No, I didn't know every difference in 3s. But I would argue that all of those minor gameplay/strat differences probably EQUAL the damage difference in MvC2. I don't know if you've ever played the game, but losing Sentinel in ONE LESS AHVB than in arcade is pretty fucking annoying. There is nothing you can do to make the damage the same.  But the reason it hasn't been addressed is because, again, very VERY few people have had serious MvC2 tournies on console. Arcade has always been the standard. If there were console, it pretty much amounted to \u201ca bunch of scrubs, and Justin\u201d in which case the damage difference makes ZERO impact. But at EVO, it's going to make an Impact.  You're going to see Cable dominate even more, along with more chipping strategies, because damage and chip are accentuated. No, it doesn't make a character totally different (like Urien in 3s) but it DOES totally change the balance of power in the game. Cable now slightly edges out Sentinel IMO because if you catch him with two viper beams, he has 1% life left. Teams that normally get beaten pretty fast will now hold out even longermaybe enough to get an extra win or two in the Round Robin poolsedging out over other players who normally would win on arcade.  Jump back Cable/Doom becomes near godlike. Eddie Lee is going to get top 10 at EVO if he goes and uses that team, because the chip damage is around 10% more. Considering that the RR pools are two out of three, you're basically making it a handicap for anyone who hasn't played console and didn't know that chip is more effective on DC.  But I guess it doesn't matter, because the only character that's totally unplayable is Anakaris. Maybe if MvC2 was a \u201cstraight-up\u201d fighter, more people would care. But the VS series has always been the bastard son of SF, so it's not surprising that nobody in charge really gives a damn.", "metadata": {"source": "SRK", "author": "DarksydePhil"}}
{"text": "<YCR>: The immediate issues were always the control issues, because let's face it, in NO other game do you mash like you do in MvC2, and so you're more likely to accidentally pause the game or go into \u201canalog mode\u201d a.k.a. screw yourself in the ass mode.  But nobody has really brought up the other issues for this reason: there have been very few serious MvC2 console tournaments. Nobody would have noticed the differences unless they've played in a few console tournies. I myself have played in a few and I noticed the probs. Then I went online and talked to a few people, like Justin Wong and other notable players who are good at noticing things like that, and they confirmed.  In casual play the differences won't matter. That's why nobody really cares up to this point. But when you get into a serious tourney atmosphere, and you die to Doom chip, you'll be like \u201cWTF just happened? That's not like that on arcade\u201d and so on. There are going to be a few upsets and a lot of whining about results since most people don't know about these differences.

{"text": "<YCR>: January 29, 2004  You Are All Mindless  a.k.a. Why Counter-Strike and Warcraft 3 Suck  It's very sad when you look at the state of PC gaming today, and at the most played games out there right now.  At one time, there were great games like Doom, Quake, Starcraft, and Unreal Tournament.  But somewhere along the line, people decided they'd rather play hyped-up, overrated games purely because of the sheer number of other players available, and because word of mouth made the games \"cool.\"  Somewhere, the quality of gameplay, and the fun factor disappeared, replaced by being the guy who's good at \"that popular game.\"  Counter-Strike  I've seen better graphics on the PSX. Someone tell that guy in front of you that it's too fucking hot in the desert to wear a ski mask.  The reason that Counter-Strike originally gained popularity was because it was the first reasonable mod to the then-#1 PC game, Half-Life.  At the time, a team-based first person shooter such as CS had never been created before, besides the superjumping, rocket-launching craziness of games like Quake.  Unfortunately, games like Rainbow Six totally blew away CS, but nobody noticed.  Why does CS suck now? It's pretty obvious. First and foremost, the graphics are extremely outdated; everyone in the game looks like they're made up of fucking cardboard boxes your six-year-old cousin doodled on.  You should not be playing this game in 2004 if you still have half a brain left. Unfortunately, if you've been playing CS this long, all hope is probably lost.  But graphics don't matter if you have a game with awesome gameplay. Unfortunately, CS comes up short in this respect as well.  CS suffers from an acute case of WTFAI? Syndrome.  That stands for What the FUCK Am I?  CS has no idea what kind of a game it's supposed to be. Unlike the superjumping, eat fourteen lazer-blasts-to-the-chest games like Quake and Unreal Tournament, CS attempts to be realistic and bring in true-to-life team combat with real life weapons and voice communication.  But CS is the furthest from realistic you can get. You will literally take a submachine gun and litter the corridor with bullets, hitting your opponent numerous times. Yet, he'll simply let one fly and kill you instantly. The problem here is that there is next to no reaction to getting shot.....you simply just keep shooting away like a madman on speed who feels no pain. On top of that, you can UNrealistically get hit numerous times and not die, still running around the screen happily and spray-painting walls. Last time I checked, you can't go into a full sprint after both of your kneecaps have been blown off.  The game sports a ton of real-life guns, but anyone who's actually handled a gun will tell you that the virtual representations of these weapons do not realistically reflect their behavior or usefulness in the real world. On top of that, I didn't realize that the M16 made the same sound as the Uzi when discharged(what I'm getting at is, some gun sound effects are totally off, not necessarily that the M16 sound is actually the same as the Uzi's in-game).  Many games have done much better in both the wacky-FPS and realistic team FPS genres.  Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament 2003 were unrealistic, but fun as all hell.  Rainbow Six and it's sequels like Raven Shield have proven to be the most realistic and team-reliant games ever released. Although these games are totally different, both are fun as hell, and dominate the FPS genre in terms of quality.  However, CS has no idea what kind of a game it wants too be. Trying too hard to be a \"realistic team FPS,\" CS gets lost in the middle somewhere.  On top of all this, most of the maps that are played are garbage.  In fact, if you play CS for more than 20 minutes on any server, chances are you'll have played on the same maps 2 or 3 times. This is because, out of all the years the game has been out, and all the mods and custom maps available, only about a handful are actually tournament-worthy for serious play.  You WILL play the sand fortress level, and the level that's an inexplicable square with a few chunks of wall in between. Very realistic. Most of the time, however, you'll end up on a server with a bunch of fucking 14 year olds who want to play some ridiculous map like \"YOU ARE A MOUSE IN THE KITCHEN.\"  If I wanted to pretend I was a mouse in an oversized kitchen, I'd go play Tom and Jerry, thanks.  The fact of the matter is, it's 2004. CS's graphics are shit, the gameplay is ass, and the game is old and outdated. It doesn't matter how many mindless idiots play the game, or if it's \"the #1 most played multiplayer game EVER.\" CS has no idea what kind of a game it wants to be, and it gets its ass kicked by fun shootem-ups like Quake/Unreal Tournament, or realistic team games like Rainbow Six. If you are looking to get into FPS games and think that CS is the way to go, you are horribly wrong. Save yourself some aggravation and wait for Doom 3 and Unreal Tournament 2004, both out before the second half of this year.  And if you still play CS competitively......you, sir, are a fucking moron.  Warcraft 3  Don't be fooled; all those cool-looking units on the screen are just there to make it look complex. Whore the Hero out for sure victory.  Ah, Warcraft 3. We all had such high hopes and dreams for this game after Blizzard's most successful outing ever, StarCraft. Starcraft was so successful that it's still recognized the world over as the #1 best Realtime Strategy game of all time.  The game is still played competitively in Korea and thousands of dollars are given out to tournament winners. Hell, people who are good at StarCraft in Korea are treated like celebrities, getting on TV-shows and having fangirls fuck their brains out, as if they were Justin Timberlake.  Warcraft 3 DOES NOT EVEN TOUCH Starcraft.  From day 1, Warcraft 3 had a million problems, including horrible game bugs (like the human farm glitch that gave humans unlimited money for no reason) and ridiculous balance issues (like the utterly unstoppable Orc Tower Rush in one of the early versions of the game). But we've all come to expect things like this from newly released games, so I can't shit on Blizzard for that.  Blizzard has made an effort to constantly improve WC3 from the very beginning. They have actively patched the hell out of the game, eliminating 99% of bugs and glitches. However, their \"constant update strategy\" has proven to be a double-edged sword.  The problem here is that Blizzard can't decide what they want the final game to be. Since its release almost three years ago, Warcraft 3 has been patched about once every two months. The problem here is, every time the game is patched, there are massive changes in game balance.  For example, in one update Blizzard will make Orc Towers lower in defense, so they are easier to kill and the \"tower rush\" is not as effective. But they will also make some hero's abilities more powerful, then make another unit have 20 less MP. So basically, they make little tweaks here and there that at first seem unimportant, but after a month of competitive play, end up totally changing the balance of the game. Every month or two, when a new patch comes out, it's like you're playing a totally new game; you have to re-learn the top strats and things that will work in order to succeed.  However, this is not necessarily a good thing. Games are supposed to be judged on fun factor as well as skill level and complexity involved.  How fun is a game that you have to constantly relearn, over and over, every month or so? It turns out being more work than it's worth. At one point you're just going to get frustrated and turn away from the game. On top of that, most of the  \"little tweaks\" that Blizzard makes are inexplicable.  Nobody asks for them, and nobody can figure out WHY Blizzard makes the changes.  One has to wonder if there's some little magical elf whispering into the ears of the game developers, telling them that such changes need to take place.  Stay off the fucking drugs, guys.  One thing that Blizzard has NEVER fixed, however, is the number one reason why WC3 is nothing like Starcraft, and will never reach that level: the importance of heroes. Let's face it, in WC3 if you do not make a hero, you lose. For free. Heroes are absolutely crucial to the game because of their massive HP, strength, and unit-boosting spells.  In Starcraft, every unit was important. If you were a good player, you could control a single marine and harass the shit out of someone through superb control, killing off numerous units and fucking up their game to no end. The key to victory was not just massing and attacking, but the micro-management of your units, the unit placement, and other skillful factors. This made the game fun.  However, WC3's gameplay is based solely around the hero and what he can do. Make an Archmage and use MP boost to make all of your magic units powerful; get a Dread Lord and have him cast some bullshit aura on your Undead, etc.  Basically, the entire battle is centered on the hero, and what ability he has.  Micromanagement DOES come into play, but moreso on the hero and what spells he casts, rather than on the individual units themselves. In most cases, units can just be set to \"auto\" and then they will cast their important abilities without your attention.....so you can spend more time whoring out your hero.  That's what WC3 boils down to, really: whoring out your hero all day, while keeping his HP high and using him to run away when you're losing. If your hero dies, but your opponent's hero is still alive, you are fucked and you lose for free. No exceptions.  You can NOT win with units alone in this game, unlike Starcraft.  So, instead of creating a game like Starcraft, where the type of units you create, the number of units, the unit placement, and the micromanagement are all important...Blizzard chose to make WC3 a game centered solely around the existence of one or two units on each team. That's a step backward rather than a step forward. On top of that, the game is updated so frequently that you are forced to re-learn the game on a bi-monthly basis, turning it into more work than it is worth.  On top of all this, I still hear that despite all the patches, WC3 is still unbalanced. Give me a break. Three years of tweaks, and night elves still get owned by certain strategies no matter what.  Well...  I'm going to use an analogy here that I think the Street Fighter players among you might like, but others will cringe at (sorry Joe).  Take MvC2, the most-played SF game in the US today.  Imagine that Capcom actually patched their games, like Blizzard actively patches WC3 every few months.  Now, imagine that after the first three months of play, Capcom recognized that Cable's Air Hyper Viper Beam was a problem: It was too fast, it was too invincible, and it was too easily comboable into itself. So, Capcom patches the game, and makes it so that Cable's AHVB is now slower, or does less damage, or you can only combo two instead of 3+.  ...BUT at the same time, Capcom also tweaks Shuma Gorath, and makes him fast as hell. As fast as Magneto. There's no reason for this change, it's just made with no explanation.  Well, two months pass. Cable is still played, but it's discovered that Sentinel is now the #1 character in the game, because Cable's AHVB is slower and can't really beat anything Sentinel does anymore. So Capcom tweaks Sentinel and takes away his unfly mode; every time he unflies he is completely vulnerable.  ...also, Capcom decides to randomly give Thanos a new super that does 20% block damage and is unpunishable. Also, Captain Commando's corridor now does double damage. Why? No idea.  Imagine if Capcom kept making these game-changing patches every few months. The game would be totally different every time a new patch was released. Do you really think that MvC2 would have such a massive following (like it has today) if it were a constantly changing, unstable game, where the top tiers were always uncertain and things were always changing like crazy?  The reason that MvC2 has become such a popular game is because, despite its flaws, it has a variety of play, even though its top tier is fairly limited. You can run and chip with Storm, you can rush down with Magneto, you can jump back and shoot them with Cable, or you can just stomp all day with Sentinel. Each character is a totally different way to play the game, and despite the fact that the top tier is mainly 6 guys, there is VARIETY and fun to the game.  If the game was constantly patched, that variety would be artificially induced. Meaning that the only reason there is variety is because Capcom keeps making balance-changing patches to the game. This creates the illusion that the game is complex, while in reality it's only forcing you to relearn a new basic dominating strategy, that will be changed in another 45 days.  This is the exact situation with WC3. The game lacks variety of play, totally centered around the hero and how you whore him out. So in order to create artificial variety, Blizzard changes the game balance around every few months. Now you have a constantly fluctuating game that gets players \"hooked\" and has a small learning curve, because the game is ALWAYS NEW.  While MvC2 will forever be remembered as one of the most fun, complex fighting games of all time, WC3 will forever remain a failed experiment in the minds of most competent, competitive gamers.  Blizzard tried, but they tried to hard, and the game is more of an amalgamous, formless, shapeless  mess than a solid RTS game.  That's enough hate for now. See you in a few.  ~DSP", "metadata": {"source": "Top Haters", "author": "DSP"}}
